606,The rating on the hotel is not at all what I would expect of a tui / first choice 4* hotel. As a brand that prides itself on quality this hotel was sadly a let down for the expectations of your brand. It was tired  broken sun beds  needed some attention

420,Everything it was perfect in this holiday. It was a very small thing that I didn’t enjoy  which was the hotel room that had a bad smell all the time. But because I was in 5 excursions  so I was most of the time away  didn’t affect me very much.

472,The hotel management did not seem to have customer interests at heart as they did not have enough staff in the hotel which annoyed a number of guests and meant service was slow.
495,Our holiday was great and everything was organised very well. The only thing I would improve is the organisation of meetings with the TUI rep who covered tourists from the UK and Ireland in the RIU Garoe hotel. We arrived very late at night (2 am) to the

841,Nice Hotel but the info regarding the beach is misleading. There is no beach to talk about  just rock. For the benefit of others  the extra cost for the premium side of the hotel does not appear to be worth it. It’s a lot more money for a little extra. T

668,The luggage allowance was less than I’m used to. The return flight  what with having to vacate the room at 1100hrs and then arrival at Gatwick at 2200hrs was tiring and not ideal. The hotel was a good standard but I’m sure that you are aware that most we

824,Holiday overall was good. Could not fault the hotel Only negative was flying with easyJet. Both flights were delayed by an hour which when flying with an 8 month old became frustrating as arrived late to the hotel. The food was limited and low stocked.

469,Efficient check in at the airport and quick transfer to resort. SENSATORI TUI staff at hotel very helpful

620,Good hotel very helpful staff. However  we paid £574 board upgrade for half board which equates to approximately 646€. We only received 35€ each per day ie 70€ in total. For a week that equals 490€. we are irritated that you have taken 156€
532,The hotel and the holiday were fine. Where it went wrong was when we arrived at Alicante airport to depart. The Tui staff set out the queueing lines incorrectly causing confusion and frustration. Not one member of staff played a leadership role and the s

780,Would like to see more sociable time slots for flights. The out going flight was great  but  home bound flight a bad time and very little leg room - making it a very uncomfortable night flight.
382,Great holiday. Could do with an explanation of where to expect my pram when arriving at destination. Stood at luggage carousel for over an hour waiting for it to come out only to find it had been dump at another part of luggage collection.
744,Reliable hotels but some representatives not sufficiently trained to answer queries without seeking help
364,Outbound flight was great. Food especially good. Appreciated the improved climate/reduced fatigue caused by the Dreamliner. Inbound meal was dried up and virtually inedible.
587,The flight went well and the staff were friendly. It was easy to find the TUI rep after baggage and be directed to the bus transfer. The transfer was over 2 hours to the hotel  this been 30 mins longer than necessary due to taking the rep home. The bus d

483,catalogue of things that we were unhappy with. Paying extra to select seats of your choice then finding out you don't allow booking of middle and aisle seats together  made a complaint - nothing! Arrived at airport  sat on transfer bus for more than 30 m
906,When we arrived at Doncaster airport the TUI staff had no printed luggage tickets for us. They believed it was a consequence of our very late booking. A member of your TUI staff then helpfully hand wrote 2 luggage tickets for us. Unfortunately after boar
69,Flights were on time transfer from burgas to sunny beach took too long due to being sat on the bus for 30mins before setting off with no explaination
849,It is the second time i travel with Tui but this time was a package of flights and accomodation and i have to say that i loved the experience The customer service received is really good as you can see that the staff really cares and are genuinely happy 
93,Had a fab time  all went well except for an over zealous check in assistant who made me put my hand luggage in the hold for a few grammes .
310,Although delayed outbound the flight and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. . Transfer seemed a bit chaotic with little info. Resort was faultless and spotlessly clean. . Reps were knowledgeable and approachable were faultless
896,Reasonably priced holidays with a variety of destinations to choose from.
137,Easy on line booking straight forward no bidding cost always feel at ease and better quality holiday when booking with tui
702,Easy to book But bit confusing booking through TUI  first choice hotel and Thomas Cook flights. Couldn’t get app for any to wirk
14,Overall there was much that was good but tbe flights were uncomfortable
688,Needed assistance at airports leaving newcastle was fine leaving allicante was horrendous and very stressful.
660,"very little contact before we went on our holiday, despite us booking a year in advance. lots of problems with reference numbers, online log-ins and atoll certificate would not work/print. lack of support when trying to get basic details emailed to us and last minute call reminders. when our holiday was sold to us, the lack of detail provided was unacceptable. wifi and safe had to be paid for on arrival and the overall holiday was not as was explained to us i.e. not fully all inclusive and the extras we paid for i.e. sea view was not at all a 'sea' view, rather a jungle view. we will not be traveling via Thomson or first choice in the future."
793,Good holiday at the hotel Angela in Fuengirola food good could do with more choice of gluten free desserts also a bit more variety in entertainment.
885,Holiday easily booked and great value
212,I have never had problems with TUI but l did have 3 little niggles this time 1 the flight was late just a hour not a problem but my cases must have been left out in the rain the whole time hard cases but both my husbands and my case clothes were soaking 
299,Holiday was spoiled by the fact that we had hoped to re-charge our batteries with early nights to catch up on sleep as we have busy long days with our jobs. But the evening entertainment meant that we were unable to sleep until late. We thought that the 
4,Holiday was good and rep at resort was very informative. Best welcome meeting for many a year. Check in was slow and confusing at Manchester. 1hr delayed outbound. Staff on return flight weren't customer focused.
17,Never had one problem from booking holiday to flights and hotel there was always a tui rep on hand to help we had no problems whatsoever with any part of our holiday experience
719,everything was explained fully during the booking of our holiday and was kept up to date by e-mail

370,Flight there was great - we were on row 4 so had lots of room. I didn't like the fact we weren't able to print our boarding passes earlier though - this made me very anxious as i've never gone to an airport without the passes. Flight back wasn't great bu
664,This was a flight only trip. The flight was better than expected. Felt well looked after. Food was great and movie choice. What I didn't like was the horrendously long queue on arrival at Sanford passport control.
747,The holiday was well organised. Checking in at the airport went smoothly.
176,The booking process  the flights transfers and AI package all work well. The cruise package is good value  the ship was nice  staff very friendly and helpful but we were a little disappointed with the availability and waiting times in the restaurants. Th

959,Resort experience fantastic Flight terrible cramped and to hot
141,We had a good experience with our travel arrangements
247,Overall the experience was very good  although the flight was a Norwegian flight so any credit here would be down to them. The only thing that let the holiday down was our room which we are very disappointed about.
833,The travel advisor was very knowledgable and helpful  she found us a deal on attraction tickets for while we were on holiday. The experience would have been better if the price on the in store system matched the online price as this would have saved us t

339,The booking process was simple. The flights were on time and flight staff friendly.

319,Our flight back was delayed by an hour. Then we arrived in Manchester we were still on the plane for nearly an hour before we were able to leave the plane. What I found frustrating was the lack of communication with the passengers to explain the reason f

561,We did not book a holiday with TUI but did book a return flight. The checking in process at Gatwick took over an hour and our return jouney proved to be little better with the same amount of time being taken to check in.
575,The rep was superb A really helpful  a great familiarising free walk on the 1st morning and great with recommending trips. Flights etc all went really smoothly  and staff were pleasant at every turn

195,Had a great time
448,Flight was poor. Hotel was good
767,The only complaint that I have is the length of time that is spend sitting on the coach at the airport waiting to leave for the hottel. I cant understand why when we arrived at the resort and only had to go around the corner to the hottel the driver turn
612,The rep who travelled with us to resort was extremely odd. She focused on the Benidorm passengers  and her appearance was shocking
216,Very easy to view holiday online before you go. Easy to select seats & check-in. Quick luggage drop off at airport & quick & efficient boarding. Helpful TUI reps at destination airport & hotel. Service on aeroplane could be improved. We were missed a cou

891,We've just got back from our honeymoon booked with TUI and it was amazing! They sorted the whole thing  flights  transfers  accommodation & excursions. Everything was perfect! Our rep met us straight at the airport when we landed  she was very helpful an
325,Good price for last minute holiday. Good position hotel. TUI rep to deal with issue to resolution needs tobe improved. Price of excursions expensive compared to independent booking with local travel
748,The planes were comfortable and the staff friendly and attentive. However on the flight out and back we were delayed by approximately 2 hours each Way. On the way back from Alicante there was a lot of confusion and lack of information. When on the plane 
89,The car hire was suppose to be free but we ended up paying over 809 dollars!!! Total rip off could have paid for car hire at home and got it cheaper. Called ahead to speak to someone and as assured it would all be fine when we arrived at airport. It wasn

853,We needed to amend the date of our original holiday due to work commitments however we were unable to due to the cost- you wanted to charge us the cost of the holiday again to amend. We ended up changing the name for family to travel instead
133,All contact with TUI representatives throughout the booking process  subsequent contact prior to the holiday  flight staff  hotel rep and excursions was predominantly of a very high standard. The only exception being one of the reps on a TUI excursion wa

897,Nothing went well apart from the flight there and back. The holiday was disgusting!!!!!
456,No rep in hotel at all  wasn't told this by anyone. When we did email about a trip it took 36 hours to get back to us. Felt dumped. Have used tui for years but will think twice in future.
932,the staff on the flight back from Tenerife south on 1st october to doncaster were very friendly and helpful . yes i know they had more free time due to flight only half full but it was honestly one of the best flights ive had .

353,The name of the first week of the cruise was Cuban Fusion. The highlight was supposed to be the visit to Havana. This was curtailed prior to our departure and on our day of arrival we did not dock until 14.00. Leaving the vesssel was a real nightmare. La

980,Very easy to book on line. No problems with flights  transfers or accommodation.

941,Crew on the flight was really nice  comfortable seats  land in time  the fact that they call us to embark by rows make it easier and faster other aerlines should use the same system
303,There have been problems with previous bookings which have already been communicated. You're having to build the trust up again !!
530,The holiday was booked online  the TUI website was easy to navigate & we had no problems - we normally go to the TUI shop in Swansea as the staff are so friendly  helpful & knowledgeable especially Emma who booked our previous and next holiday. The staff

217,Flight experience was good along side cleanliness and service during the flight. Downfall being an hour and half delay due to a technical issue and long delays at arrival end with baggage reclaim which almost took an hour also. Return flight was faultles
874,There was nothing that could be improved. Everything was perfect.
363,First choice and TUI are always helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Simple to book with and no hasstle. Will always go to TUI or first choice as a first option never any faults will always recommend  only improvement could of been the food but that
722,Everything went well no complaints
208,Greater hand luggage weight. 5kls is the weight of a bag!
48,I booked the holiday in a store in Coventry  I needed to do a name change on the booking 3 days before. Online stated upto 24 hours before travelling. I called one evening  the lady I spoke to in the store wasn't interested in helping me as it was close 
817,We booked on line with no problem however it was a Thomas Cook flight and we eventually found out that we had to go on to Thomas cook site to book seats and book on line. Return boarding passes not available until 24 hoursbefore return  when we went into

899,The crew on the flight out where rude to my mother in law who requiers oxygen 24-7 and they made her feel very small and a burden to them all and the hotel was not much better the only good part about was the flight home as the Spanish where very helpful
435,TUI do a good job with the package holiday. you know what to expect and there are no surprises. The whole experience was good from start to finish and went like clockwork. Flight OK  transfers timely and hotel fine.
40,To whom it may concern: Upon departure  While checking our suitcase in  my fiancé and I were over weight by 4 kilos. However we were informed by the lady checking us in that it was ok as my fiancé never had hand luggage and therefore we were within our c
431,First time at Sirenis  Cala Llonga and have not done an all inclusive anywhere for nearly 10 years. It was an excellent experience for a change and would consider A.I. again as being abroad in Euroland is so expensive to drink and eat out. We are so luck
262,As usual all was good  straightforward easy transfers to and from resort. Good availability if the rep at resort  although she could have been more knowledgable about walks etc.
79,flight - outbound flight was with Norwegian Air - seats roomy and comfortable  good choice of food on board. flight - return flight was with Tiu  seats much smaller not so comfortable  good choice of food on board. Hotel - definitely NOT a 5 star
963,Gym equipment and food.There was variety of food but it was over cooked.q
185,Great holiday but devastated as 1of our 3 cases was so smashed up when we arrived in Majorca.??
187,The journey went really well with a great end to it where my daughter was allowed to sit in the cockpit. This was a great experience for her and it was greatly appreciated. We would definitely fly with TUI again. The only issue we had was that we paid fo
121,easy to book online. great service on the plane & in the resort
62,Previously travelled with yourselves and had really good experiences and nothing changed on this trip. Webside easy to use  making booking straightforward. Airport and flight experience were great and went to schedule. Resort reps available daily  not th
447,I did not like the check in at Birmingham airport. I prefer to be checked in by a person not a machine
439,Great package holiday with flights  accommodation and transfers included at a good rate. They look after you and would happily book again.
949,Would have scored higher but outbound and inbound flights were both delayed by an hour.
506,Apart from having to check your own bags in which I think is disgusting the rest went well
45,Online booking system is really simple  detailed and easy to use. You were the most competitive in terms of price for the whole of this summer  for both your villas and your package holidays. The TUI rep whilst we were at the Sarakina was no where to be 
227,Generally very good no problems good flight . I did expect some free snacks & a drink with it being a 4 hour flight but luckily we are members of the vip lounge & had a meal before flying
307,The cabin crew were very helpful without being intrusive. On our outgoing journey there was a delay  our three year old granddaughter was travelling with us  so she was very excited. The pilot came along the aircraft and explained the reason for the dela
663,Everything thing went well  fantastic first family holiday with our baby daughter. Flying by Dreamliner was particularly useful with a baby and all members of staff were approachable and helpful.
556,Overall  a good holiday. The Airport Lounge at LGW allowed a great start to the holiday however the Premium Check In experience could be improved  as the customer service wasn’t consistent with the rest of the holiday. Great flight crew and TUI transfers
317,Pleasant experience from start to finish. No problems encountered  team at airport were very friendly and informative.
202,Everything was perfect  couldn't have asked for more.
425,Wider aircraft seats
120,The only thing that could be improved is the system for guiding planes in to Kos Airport. Apparently the system has been down for a few weeks restricting landings to 3 per hour  which caused delays to both flights. Most everything else went extremely wel
987,Well organised check in to ship.plenty of information of things to do onboard.Daily news letter. We thought that some of the soft drinks should be included as some people don’t drink alcohol yet some guests are drinking there chosen drink the whole day i
298,Good rep and have previously had great experiences with TUI hence the reason why rebooking with this company  however I feel the holiday was very much oversold compared to the experience. Staff were rude and unhelpful. For example  the first evening we s
764,we enjoyed the cruise but the food could be better
494,This was our 4th cruise with Marella and we have had many Thomson holidays in the past. It was our first time on the Dream and we loved it. The same high standards in all departments of the ship. Just keep doing what you do!
943,Flights on time. Well priced. Convenient time of day and great staff both in the airport and on the plane. Well organised boarding at Manchester. Lots of turbulence on return journey but staff confident and reassuring. All in all a good experience at bot
979,TUI as a company I believe does not value customers. I usually book in store who match prices this year they would only do for an admin fee. I therefore booked on line which was simple  but I prefer to book in person. For that alone I might as well go to
541,Very well organized from start to finish
617,The whole package  staff helpful  From booking  To airport  To transfers  To holidaying more can I say except we will use TUI again and again
487,I have been a regular customer of Thomson/Tui for years however I have noticed that I’ve not been able to sit with my party unless I pay for seats in advanced. This has how happened on the last two holidays booked with Tui this year.
976,15kg luggage allowance could be improved  without having to pay extra.
651,Value for money holidays with good choice of local airports. Knowledgeable staff in resort.
925,Friendly staff booked our holiday. Helped with e visa's for turkey. Always smiling.
91,Transfers were well organised  the on site rep Lindsay was excellent  very friendly and knowledgeable. She was able to answer any questions that we had using her local knowledge
813,Holiday very good only to be spoilt at airport on way home very unorganised and a lot of queuing
628,Price quality and ease of booking. Excellent reps on site. Good leg room on flights. Quality hotels and services. This is my second booking of the year with Thomson/first choice and I really can't fault them with anything. Really enjoyable relaxed breaks
640,Absolutely fantastic time from start to finish. Great flights   hotels and transfers.
351,Website easy to use  all went well with holiday. Tui staff helpful.
507,This is the first time we have used Tui and the flights were really excellent. The Dreamliner is an awesome aircraft  so quiet and the staff were amazing. We always fly with Virgin into Orlando at least twice a year but I think we have made the decision 
950,Holiday went very smoothly  on-line booking has become a bit of a farce. Had to wait up until 0100 hrs for it to open.
571,The flight  transfers  hotel reps and even the pilot on the flight home were all first class. It helped make a great holiday
61,Entertainment at night poor
274,Entertainment good shows waiter service restaurant very slow service 2 hours for 2 people snack Shack was awful no chicken no fish like on Discovery
718,Shame it cost me £30 to speak and book with someone on the phone. Internet is ok  but human interaction can not be ignored. Also the site did not inform us that the spa was out of order.
373,The crew  entertainment and food was all fab. Loved it all.
657,Booking was very easy  website responsive The booking of flight extras was hare this time  as was flying with Thomas Cook and I was passed from TUI to Thomas Cook to their 3rd Party - tenacity and determination was needed to get what I wanted. Transfers 
11,Friendly staff On time flights Good range of products on board the aircrcaft Very good with baby - pushchair on at the last minute and staff really kind and talking to baby lots. Based on th
577,Was a really lovely place to go  would definitely go back again and recommend it to friends and family.
755,The staff on board were really pleasant and helpful The online booking is really simple to use Would recommend this to .gov friends
44,Flight out fine  hotel great  however the flight home was a fiasco and was like the flight from *****. This was my third Tui holiday this year but am now seriously considering whether to use Tui again in future.
23,I have just returned from a flight-only deal to La Palma for 10 days. A few months after booking the outward leg was cancelled and I had a choice of cancelling  or changing to a week's stay or changing the outward leg from Manchester to Gatwick. I chose 
834,There was a problem with the TUI app which is difficult to use and could be a lot more straight forward  and I was unable to download my boarding pass which would have very much put my mind at ease. However  the flight itself was very comfortable and the
33,I booked my holiday to Portugal online after doing my research on the TUI website The booking processes was so quick and simple  I got exactly what I booked
917,I only had my return flight with you and I felt the plane was very cold even though I had a light jacket on and most air con around me was off
223,Overall everything went well
543,Easy to book on line  we were kept up to date with emails and the whole experience was straight forward and went to plan
381,Easy to book through the website. We went via the last minute deals section as we wanted a deal and got one so couldn’t be happier especially when the transfers and flights were included which helped take the pressure off finding our own flights and havi
794,Holiday was amazing. The entertainment was 100% every night.
354,We think nearly everything went very well. Nothing to complain about. Really enjoyed our time in tsilvi.
211,Great flight service and my partner even got to sit in the captains chair after the flight!
20,All went well  no problems really. Waited a long time on Coach at Palma  over half hour  confusion with coach at hotel on return.
474,I can honestly say nothing need improvement every question or worry I had was answered and left me reinsured   I'm definitely booking with TUI from now one.
140,Getting the seats on the aircraft which had been booked. Not having a rude cabin crew member.
129,Every thing from booking the holiday to the finish
391,Fabulous shows and great excursions/bike tours made this a holiday to remember.
138,The leg room on the flight is as bad as Ryan air! We were in row 10 and 7 and I was kneed in the back both to and from the destination. Check in at Gran Canaria was horrible! An hour just to check in! Only 3 people available. You know how many people are
244,Our holiday to Cape Verde went very smoothly apart from a few hiccups at Bristol Airport concerning the lift having broken down  very relaxing holiday.
986,The cabin crew both ways were nice. Not too much interaction with the passengers but professional enough. The rep was informative by explaining our check out options and available at the resort and was a local so knew the island very well. The flight tim
624,Great experience
883,Tui support was excellent throughout..both on arrival and at the resort. The entertainment and fitness team were excellent.
548,On the flight coming home the young lady sitting next to me was diabetic and due to the rush and heat. She started to feel unwell before we took off I explained to the air hostess a lad. He told me there was nothing he could do i asked if he had a biscui
380,Meeting new friends on a quite relaxing holiday just as described by TUI.
477,The holiday overall was good  but more communication from the TUI staff and Reps would of been good in respects of our flights  which were delayed on the outbound and inbound flights. Bristol Airports Website  knew the flights were going to be delayed  b
513,Holiday was perfect and orgenised  until I landed and went to drive out my car park which I paid for with TUI and got charged £165 for called 24/7 geting rudely blown of phone and having to pay this. Currently disputing it but put a absolute downer and e
835,Food and service was good. Adult entertainment was poor
178,This my wife and I second time of choosing aTui Holiday in 3 months and were yet again happy with the service. Choice of holidays and pricing. Most importantly we had a relaxing stress free holiday in a super location.
412,Perfect holiday from the beginning to the end. All the tui staff from the cabin crew to the rep at resort were extremely helpful and very professional. Nothing was a problem. First class service.
301,great food
222,Our return flight was less enjoyable  there were several babies and infants in our seating area who cried for most of the flight. A separate area for parents with younger children and babies may be a solution if it’s at all possible. I can’t fault the fl
860,Good initial on-line contact with TUI through booking process and relevant documents received. Outward airport experience very good  East Midlands  prompt checking-in and boarding process. Feel the TUI staff at the arrival airport  Palma  need a more han
855,Easy online booking process
305,Lovely holiday good service overall enjoyed it
437,The whole First Choice / TUI experience was great - the app was informative and really useful for quick and easy reference to the boarding passes and general holiday information as well as for info whilst on holiday linked to acitivities and departure de
666,Flight staff were excellent accomdation was worth what i paid absolutely enjoyed
578,The pilot landing in last Wednesdays gales 19/9/18 was fantastic. Please expand to future customers the length of the tfr to the airport. Over 2 hrs is too long. Please be specific so choices can be made on facts.
966,Our initial experience - attempting to book a holiday in the Kingswood store  Hull - was poor. The two girls who helped us lacked knowledge and kept skipping past holidays  talking us out of them. When I got home I looked at one of these in detail and it
706,Booking holiday went well with follow up call from shop before departure date. Flight was great  kept the kids entertained and reps were great organising everything  really helpful  always around for questions and keeping the kids entertained.
245,Everything went very well  even travelling with our autistic child  helpful people at airport and check in
686,Wasn't a tui holiday but the flight was  really pleasant staff  probably the best I have came across  would highly recommend. I've had a tui holiday in the past and it was great. Amazing for kids and families.
242,Booking was fairly easy. Flights were good and on time.
323,When youhaving the morning flight  the tui meeting should be the same day not in the next one. Because it ruins your next day... When you would be able to know everything on the same day. The staff was friendly but about the tui day tours they should exp
878,Booked on line and website was relatively easy to use. The holiday itself and the flight arrangements were good as we had upgraded to Premium Club and I would recommend that to others as the legroom on the plane was excellent.
238,Flight was delayed 2 hours. Plane got swapped from TUI plane to a Wamos plane. There was no drink and food facilities. The plane was very dirty and old. I certainly won't be flying with yourselves again
643,The holiday was okay but let's be honest this is a good 4 star hotel not a 5 star one.
117,This is the second holiday I have booked with you. I do not agree with having to pay to reserve a seat  especially when you pay nearly £2000 for a 1 week holiday. If it is a package holiday it should be included.
801,I think the 'all inclusive' drinks package is a con as water and other drinks are not included and incur a 'supplement' - for example bottled water is charged for as is cranberry juice bizarrely  as are other 'branded' soft drinks. Also  there was a supp
586,I only booked a one way flight with TIU  from Naples to Bournemouth on oct 5th. The flight boarded apprix an hour late. Once boarded  the pilot clearly explained the reason for the delay (his flight the night before arrived late so he was not allowed to 
931,Excellent holiday.tui staff went the extra mile to make our holiday special. I am not in good health but that tui staff made sure i was well accomodated. Thank you do much. Only let down was the special assistance which was non existent but nothing to do
228,Great flight times  excellent choice of airports  friendly staff
315,The experience was good.
856,I only booked the flights with you. However I booked special assistance and everything was very good indeed. Flight was on time and probably next time will a package with TUI .
167,Cheap deal but not a cheap holiday Very good
611,Had to wait over an hour for another flight to land before our coach transfer left the airport. Had we been advised that there would be a wait we could have booked a private transfer or had a cup of coffee.
766,No holiday Rep in resort so was not able to book any excursions. Only phone number provided by Rep at airport was one for a UK based center. Pretty useless. Transfer back to airport never arrived. 8 elderly people were left stranded  luckily  we managed 
70,Generally very good but the excursion to Troodos wasn’t. Poor lunch  food extremely salty and unappetising.
180,I booked this holiday online  the first ever time I've done this. I found this easy to do  but did check myself several times. On calling the local Tui shop to check the price with them as well ( which was £30.00 dearer ) I was informed that if I booked 
112,everything went well
515,Everything went well.
271,Flights reasonably on time  hotel very good  TUI rep very knowledgable and efficient
698,This was our first holiday following a major operation undergone by my partner aged 74 We had to cancel our previous in Croatia but we were determined to reactivate the holiday we had to cancel one year later We could not have been happier and cannot thi
479,We would have liked to be told that a scene holiday was for youngster
181,The website and app are both user friendly and the cost of the flight was very reasonable. In addition  staff on the flight were helpful and amenable and the check-in process was quick and well organised. I would definitely recommend TUI to anyone lookin
39,The Barut Sensatori Fetihye   Exceeded our Expectations   we loved the staff   they were so focused on us  having a great 10day stay one word   fantastic!!!!
898,with the text about the transfer back to airport  if more than one bus would help to include the bus number aswell not just the pick up time. Would make it much easier than last minute rush to find out.
700,Easy to book  stress free. Hotel  transfer and flights all as expected. Had slight problem with API because flights were with AirMalta and could not easily see that we had to do this at check in
935,Excellent flight...transfer...hotel Would strongly recommend . And the resort is top class.. Never been to Portugal before but Tui made my first trip memorable
930,Very friendly and knowledgeable towards customers by keeping us informed; for example arrival times  departure times etc
1,Booking process nice and easy. Being able to update and adjust booking through web site very useful.
147,Things that went well: website improvements where you can see the whole month so can easily see the cheapest weeks available. On-line check in. Things that could be better  the luggage allowance has reduced to 15 for your suitcase and as a solo traveler 
434,Online booking was simple  but flights with Thomas Cook added s level of confusion especially when trying to contact someone regarding a query
38,Overall the holiday was excellent with just a few niggles flight out was fine and on time coach to the ship was also good and boarding was excellent as well.cabin was large and quite well equipped except for the tv too small and all the satellite channel
869,Staff very helpful and hard working. Food really excellent. So very likely to recommend.
194,EASY TO BOOK
392,Everything went very well with the booking and transfers  flights were on time and we had no problem with tui or first choice
276,Everything went very well no complaints
393,Communication with reps could be improved. Customers should not rely on an app and should have local and immediate communication at any point during their stay. Although trips can be booked online it is unclear where pickup points are. We wanted to book 
428,Flights good food quality and drinks poor
264,The only time we saw a tui rep was in the airport on the way home . We may as well have been traveling with Ryanair .The service on the flight was very poor and extremely slow. We sat in prebooked seats having paid extra for these row 16 and it took over
41,the coach driver could not speak English a lot of people did not understand what he was saying when stopping at hotels.
761,Flight was late and the plane was filthy on the way home
527,Booking was really easy and with all the information we required for the holiday sent in plenty of time. Once on holiday we awaited the rep to arrive for our welcome meeting for nearly half an hour after the time given for the meeting. No apology was giv
333,Website was easy to navigate  good choice of holidays to choose from. Only bad point  there was no rep to meet us or guide us to the bus. We had to wait around for a while until she appeared.
840,Good holiday - the app is a great idea! I think the excursions could be improved - more choice and also not such a hefty price. You can go down the road and book the excursions for around 20% cheaper then if you buy through TUI. An option to purchase in 
807,Great flight on the dreamlike as usual. And lovely holiday rep
404,Always no issues flights are on time and comfortable  greatvflight times and plenty of options in hotels great value and choice. Reps are helpful and and available
680,Everything was great and we really enjoyed the holiday

632,Check in smooth and flight arrived on top. Hand luggage weight needs to be increased.
273,Transfer from airport too long 2.5 hours at 11 0clock at night is not good
280,Plane seats need more comfort.
699,good holiday great fun weather hot
728,very little could be improved on hence my score of 9
80,Everything was as advertised
13,No online check in   unhelpful phone in staff giving wrong info to go ask at the airport prior to departure date
46,"Return Flight - Service and choice of Food was not as good as the Outbound flight, and been as we upgraded "
50,Overall was a great holiday at a really competitive price! However this is the second holiday in as many years where I’ve used tui and my luggage has been damaged in transit.
940,Friendly staff always willing to help. The staff go beyond what is expected of them. Excellent organisations skills.
725,Good Morning   My partner ( Mrs Melledew ) and I were flight only to Gran Canaria so we can only comment on that part of this survey . However we particularly want to commend one of the flight attendants ... Laura on our return flight ( TOM 2405 ) on Thu
285,The flights were cheaper than any other companies  even though we was delayed the pilot made the time back on the flight. Had nice service and stuff on the flight
676,Dreadful  wife received food poisoning  in hospital for 3 days.
92,If booking all inclusive it takes the hassle out of applying filtersp
544,A very rude flight attendant named Jaqui on our outward flight came as a surprise. We have never experienced this hence why we feel the need to bring it to your attention. She clearly did not want to be working on Boxing Day and made it very obvious. All

136,Our reps were incredible the stress they were under due to the weather conditions. Gavin was incredible and so was the Italian rep I apologise know her her team name was I Igloo! They kept us up to date about the husky experience. It was on and off and t
186,I had a good and calm time in my flight. All the employees were polite and willing to help. I think that I'm going to travel again with TUI!!!
798,Everything thing went well and as expected.
166,Holiday was fine flight out and transfer good but in return journey cases thrown into bus by driver dropped off at airport with no TUI rep telling you where to go then airport absolute nightmare with inadequate seating flight delayed with no explanation 
145,Really easy to book in and board the plane. The flight was really nice with friendly Staff. Nothing was to much trouble  very helpful. We always like to fly with you because we know we will be looked after and arrive ready to enjoy out holiday.
214,Excellent holiday. TUI as usual were faultless. I had a question about my flight home  your representative responded immediately and reassured me and answers my question immediately. Will continue to book with TUI over all others. Recommending to others 
188,everything was good with the holiday  a big improvement would be e-tickets that are not A4 size
741,Complex is fantastic would recommend to anyone with families. I made the mistake of flying from Manchester T2 which was a disaster. Rude ignorant unprofessuo al and untrained people who couldn't give a dank about customer service. Horrible experience.
429,Quickest boarding and ready for take of process I have ever known. Attendants very warm and friendly
685,Easy pick up and transfer to hotel and like wise for the return to the airport. The Tui reps were very informative
269,Flight smooth  transfer quick and hotel excellent
261,Not loose our luggage !!
933,Easy to book online  obvious staff at the airport especially when arriving in Bulgaria. Hotel rep not very useful for a few practical things like a local map or local bus times. She only wanted to give her phone number for contact and may have been best 
8,24 hour homeward flight delay...more onformation earlier on delay
519,Had a good time
5,Special Assisstance could have made sure the hearing loop they promised would be available on the plane was actually available. They could have also made sure they passed on the information about the cabin crew asking the people in front not to recline a
452,I paid you for a holiday that you really wasn’t even involved in when we landed we was put on the bus with a spainish driver that could not speak English no rep it was meant to be a 60 min transfer that took nearly 3 hours had to just look at hotel names
267,The whole holiday far exceeded our expectations and we will certainly include first choice for future holidays.
35,I'm a single parent and have been with first choice twice. The first time I booked an abroad holiday was with yourselves. I was very scared at first but when got there was looked after by reps and made to feel save and relaxed. Really good experience couldn't have asked for better holidays
526,We were really pleased with everything about our holiday and flights we would defiantly use Tui again in the future and recommend where we stayed to friends and relatives in the future. All in all Tui is a very good airline to travel with
605,Very smooth flight  great entertainment and more or less on time
723,We had no problems with any part of the holiday  check in was good  transfer was good and the holiday rep was very nice.
383,Food not as good as on previous visits to this hotel/over cooked and tasteless.
720,It was  without a doubt  the most wonderful holiday. You could not have done any more  than what you had so highly achieved already. From the lovely staff  to the food  to the airline crew  nothing was too much trouble for them. The Family life Nevis is 
667,Everything went well on the vacation but it was a simple package holiday with no special requirements. Previous experience has shown that when special services are requested Tui can fail to deliver an efficient service.
808,Everything was good apart from flight delay
27,The shocking treatment we received as a result of a 15hr delay
923,Rep in resort could have been better
423,I choose TUI because you have direct flight from Birmingham to Cancun  I had good service during the flight  very good experience traveling the flight was amazing  any delay  the seats are fine  the food is fine  I enjoy the dutty free offers during the 
278,Holiday ran like clockwork  TUI staff brilliant
111,Pilot and crew great  just wish the plane was a bit more modern and spacious
221,Inability to check in on-line (inc API details) Lack of detail  from the rep  concerning the excursions offered i.e. that they were subcontracted to a 3rd party provider
128,Flying from our local airport makes the experience of flying so much easier and not so stressful as flying from one of the major airports.
478,I’ve travelled with Tui before and feel confident that it will run smoothly. The excursions are usually very good also
463,Informative  helpful staff. Rep went out of his way at airport to get my kindle returned to me when I left it on the plane. I don’t personally like the hard sell on trips  especially when the meeting is early the day after landing following a long haul f
150,It all went well
505,Communication from the coach driver could have been clearer  didn’t check of the names of customers wasn’t going to allow us on the coach
679,My experience with TUI was amazing! Book the flight was really easy and with a reasonable price. Then on the website everything was really easy to find and manage. I needed special assistance as I had crutches and all the staff on the plane was really he
318,The website is sometimes slow to load and update with live availability especially when trying to book last minute. Flight was good both ways  staff are friendly at check in and on the flight.

964,Better arrangements for airport assistance  you helped as much as you could everything else was good

488,Good flight times Poor communication in resort re departues
550,For our onwards journey  while going for online check in  the system did not allow and we contacted TUI office for online check in. We were told that TUI does not do online checkin. We have to reach airport two hours prior to departure. The flight was on
489,Easy check in and boarding
100,Flights were good transfers were good. Airplane attendents were good. No complaints
863,"It would be better if a TUI plane was used instead of Norwegian Airlines, especially as it was a TUI holiday."
450,Great holiday  good rep & a good airline too. Info was easy to access online with booking & printing necessary info off. It was good to see excursions we could do online & plan for the holiday. Reps abroad are friendly too  making you feel safe
671,Firstly the overall price of my flights was very reasonable and I have no cause for complaint. I believe the 5kg limit for hand luggage is too low. Also its not very clear if a ladys handbag is classed as 1 unit of hand luggage  people with children need
787,All well extremely smoothly from start to finish
830,We had a great time Cape Verde . The turtle watch trip was amazing and the guide was very knowledgeable. It was great to go out at night and see first hand the turtles coming ashore  laying their eggs and then going back into the sea. Something you may n
875,Andrea in the Canterbury agency was extremely helpful in finding a holiday to suit our needs. The flight crew on the outbound flight were incredible and really made Alice’s maiden flight memorable by providing her with a certificate and letting her meet 
356,Great holiday plenty of leg space on the plane
410,Better flight times scheduled from newcastle. Tired of night flights.
220,The family holiday was a great success
832,Good value for money. I could have done without the email informing me that check-in was open - when it wasn't!
553,I can not think of anything that could have improved my holiday with TUI. It was truly fantastic from start to finish! Our first family holiday travelling with our 2 year old was so stress free! Great entertainment for the whole family and completely des
926,i have sent e mail via maidstone store
951,Fantastic service
432,Gassed by sewerage transfer every day
593,Flight times were great and punctual but no online check in again. Last time I flew it was the same. You could make life so much easier for yourselves
859,Ticked all the boxes
482,5kg hand luggage is probably one of the worst allowances! Long check in queues and a delay of 45mins - not a great start.
825,Everything was good no negatives.
352,Brill from start to finish
36,Great holiday  activities people food and service great
384,Very competitively priced holiday
603,The website was slow  and instead of saying ‘there is a problem  please phone or call into store’  actually tell us there are no holidays or flights left.
332,Tui made the trip to Cyprus very easy.
703,Ease of booking online. Much cheaper onlone than in store which where you may be missing out. I'd hate for my local TUI branch to close as they can't match the online price! I do prefer to speak to someone face to face rather than call a call centre.
774,It was perfect.
9,It was perfect
375,All went very well . Stayed in Thompson Gold  Excellent.
388,Service before holiday was great. Big safeguarding issues during our holiday which has already been raised and being dealt with

789,Excellent customer service. Good email communication following booking.
613,Really easy to book holiday using your website including being able to select different flights so maximise the time away.. Lots of information and reminders shared via the e-mails sent.
727,Value for money  flights on time  staff available at airport.
627,Hand baggage allowance on board the flight is too restrictive. No check in on line of for the return flight is very inconvenient. Requirement to be at the airport 2.5 hours prior to departure is excessive.
184,Smooth passage all the way reps available when required also phone number to call anytime day or night.hotel good also staff there friendly would go again
175,Flight and service was great
537,Your web site is really poor. It didn’t work and the boarding passes were hidden under random headings and useless.

304,Always had good service and holiday as described.
213,All went very well.no problems whatsoever.
360,Usually had great holidays with Tui  but the last 6 have had flight delays. It would nice to go away and not have the delay. Other than that bit would be good to see more of the reps at resort.

677,"This about our 15th holiday using thonson's, never let us down so far, long may that continue!! It seems to be a well organised company that wants you to have good holidays at reasonable prices and big enough to look after you if anything goes wrong."
637,Every thing was good. No complaints.certain.
670,Entertainment was top -notch. Boarding could have been better  Celebrity pick up cases from your car.
661,Long delay due to inefficient staff and systems.. Being treated by condescending flight staff unable to tell the truth. Using customer hysteria to excuse operational failures. Treating customers as unthinking morons rather than reasoning adults.
18,Long waiting time in coach at airport ??
701,highly recommed tui i have a great experance from start to finish
306,Seemless the whole process
398,Flights on time
769,Crew were lovely and very helpful
454,Every thing went good on my holiday to Mexico went premium class which I try to do on long haul holidays cant find fault with anything from check in till I returned. Would be nice to have access to lounge on return airport .
