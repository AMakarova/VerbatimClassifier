7876404,Resort reps not interested
7876407,Holiday was good and rep at resort was very informative. Best welcome meeting for many a year. Check in was slow and confusing at Manchester. 1hr delayed outbound. Staff on return flight weren't customer focused.
7876408,Special Assisstance could have made sure the hearing loop they promised would be available on the plane was actually available. They could have also made sure they passed on the information about the cabin crew asking the people in front not to recline a
7876410,Firstly the difference between 4T and 4* should be made more clear as interpretation of each is slightly misleading. From the web site I used there no real indication that the hotel was family oriented  so in both instances more clarity needed. However t

7876472,Overall there was much that was good but tbe flights were uncomfortable
7876479,I was quite upset that the price of our flights increased 3 times during the booking process (external flight provider  but 3x in 5minutes is not right). Well organised trip and wonderful hotel staff. Good kids entertainment.
7876481,Flight there was 2 hours delayed  they also moved our flight home an hour earlier. So we had less time on holiday. Also the food at the hotel wasn’t very good  so I feel a bit let down of what I was expecting my all inclusive holiday to be.

7877023,This is the second holiday I have booked with you. I do not agree with having to pay to reserve a seat  especially when you pay nearly £2000 for a 1 week holiday. If it is a package holiday it should be included.

7877197,Our experience on the plane journey out was one to be forgotten having been kept behind at security where our baby liquids were being checked. We missed last call and as a result the gate closed. Thanks to the Tui staff we were permitted on the plane and
7877203,Staff were all very friendly and obliging. Cabin was kept clean. Food was good and always available when back late to ship. We liked sitting with different people each evening in the restaurant. Maps of destinations were not very clear. It would be good

7877256,Everything was just perfect
7877257,Excellent hotel location  but our garden room was at street level and had a rectangular glass panel adjacent to the door which was a mix of clear and opaque glass. This meant that passers by could see in to the beds - especially if the room was lit. We h

7877372,This my wife and I second time of choosing aTui Holiday in 3 months and were yet again happy with the service. Choice of holidays and pricing. Most importantly we had a relaxing stress free holiday in a super location.
7877388,Clean  tidy  staff helpful and polite. At times logistics of feeding so many people meant having to wait for crockery and cutlery. Due to time lag  and popularity of al Le carte returaunts we were only able to book for two.
7877393,I booked this holiday online  the first ever time I've done this. I found this easy to do  but did check myself several times. On calling the local Tui shop to check the price with them as well ( which was £30.00 dearer ) I was informed that if I booked 
7877397,The website and app are both user friendly and the cost of the flight was very reasonable. In addition  staff on the flight were helpful and amenable and the check-in process was quick and well organised. I would definitely recommend TUI to anyone lookin

7877435,I had a good and calm time in my flight. All the employees were polite and willing to help. I think that I'm going to travel again with TUI!!!
7877436,The journey went really well with a great end to it where my daughter was allowed to sit in the cockpit. This was a great experience for her and it was greatly appreciated. We would definitely fly with TUI again. The only issue we had was that we paid fo
7877437,everything was good with the holiday  a big improvement would be e-tickets that are not A4 size
7877442,Very efficient and easy organisation. Friendly staff on coach transfer. Easy to organise trips and good choice  helpful introductaror meeting and info on local area/ ideas on things to do. Overall happy with tui service although hotel staff outside of tu
7877448,Powdered fruit drink machines at a 4 starhotel. Tiny shower with silly doors. Spa and pool closing by 18.30. No light on balcony. Wifi too many times you had to sign in.

7877459,Great location  nice hotel  friendly staff  very clean and kept in good repair
7877461,This was our first cruise and we loved it. The ship was clean and practical fufilling all our needs. The food was incredible  especially the meat - the chefs on Marella cellebration should be very proud of themselves! We did the Nelsons Dockyard trip org
7877470,EASY TO BOOK
7877474,Had a great time
7877475,Nice hotel food could be better. Long transfer from airpiort
7877485,I cannot fault the holiday village in seregemie in any shape or form. Staff  food  facilities  entertainment was excellent. The only issue is the all inclusive wrist bands. Why not use photographic key cards especially for adults.
7877490,Check in smooth and flight on time. Good flight and first class airport reception by Tui staff  return to uk perfect
7877495,we stayed at the Jardine in son bou and it's the best place I've stayed at in menorca   the staff were excellent very friendly  they couldn't do enough for us and the place was immaculate  I would definitely go back

7877524,Everything was perfect  couldn't have asked for more.
7877527,Reps were fine always on hand to answer questions made themselves known to all. Very knowledgeable of the area and resort. Andrew and Emily obviously loved what they do. It was the hotel that let is down . Tired and dated in parts Was just the hotel
7877529,Was a lovely holiday. Hotel brilliant

7877532,Excellent service and hotel was lovely great location. From booking holiday and hotel rep was brilliant she took time to help and took us on a walking trip which was brilliant.
7877538,If u have a problem how big or small it's a problem for you your representative should try to help you not just hope you will go away
7877541,Greater hand luggage weight. 5kls is the weight of a bag!
7877543,All was great  only one thing really made me very annoyed TUI charged me £60.00 to keep our room for the extra day  only to find out from hotel reception they only charge £14.00  £36.00 difference..WHY!!!!
7877545,The hotel
7877548,Great flight service and my partner even got to sit in the captains chair after the flight!
7877551,I have never had problems with TUI but l did have 3 little niggles this time 1 the flight was late just a hour not a problem but my cases must have been left out in the rain the whole time hard cases but both my husbands and my case clothes were soaking 
7877552,All went very well.no problems whatsoever.
7877557,Excellent holiday. TUI as usual were faultless. I had a question about my flight home  your representative responded immediately and reassured me and answers my question immediately. Will continue to book with TUI over all others. Recommending to others 
7877564,You have stolen our money
7877568,Very easy to view holiday online before you go. Easy to select seats & check-in. Quick luggage drop off at airport & quick & efficient boarding. Helpful TUI reps at destination airport & hotel. Service on aeroplane could be improved. We were missed a cou
7877575,Flight experience was good along side cleanliness and service during the flight. Downfall being an hour and half delay due to a technical issue and long delays at arrival end with baggage reclaim which almost took an hour also. Return flight was faultles
7877578,On the flight going to destination when the main meal was brought out there was wine on offer I asked if it was possible to get a soft drink as I'm expecting so unable to drink wine and was told it was wine or nothing I would have to wait for drink servi
7877579,This was our first ever cruise  and overall it was a great experience. However  having never previously been on a cruise ship  on arrival we had to ask someone to direct us to our cabin.
7877596,The family holiday was a great success
7877599,Inability to check in on-line (inc API details) Lack of detail  from the rep  concerning the excursions offered i.e. that they were subcontracted to a 3rd party provider
7877602,Our return flight was less enjoyable  there were several babies and infants in our seating area who cried for most of the flight. A separate area for parents with younger children and babies may be a solution if it’s at all possible. I can’t fault the fl
7877614,Overall everything went well
7877615,We feel that our holiday was very enjoyable. We feel safer with a package holiday but the standards and quality of TUI after the name change are clear. The aircraft was shabby (hope this was just the inside) and not very clean and not having a TUI rep on
7877625,In resort staff not helpful
7877631,Pads on the roof terrace loungers! The room initially smelt of cigarette smoke  luckily I had some room spray and we left the windows open!
7877646,Generally very good no problems good flight . I did expect some free snacks & a drink with it being a 4 hour flight but luckily we are members of the vip lounge & had a meal before flying
7877653,Great flight times  excellent choice of airports  friendly staff
7877656,More choice of cocktails would have been good. Hotel perhaps slightly tired in places. But overall pretty much as expected.
7877660,All really good  no complaints
7877661,1/ The flights were poor. Cabins were cramped and they ran out of hot food. 2/ The hotel staff were great  But in the mornings they were more intent on clearing than looking after you at breakfast and lunch. Getting a drink or cutlery was very slow.
7877676,Reasonable flights good hotel
7877684,Hotel as excellent as ever - this was our 7th visit. Impressed that some staff from the 1990's are still there and that they have now introduced more Greek dishes. Transfers very well handled  except one case left behind at hotel on return journey. but T
7877688,Some of the aspects of the hotel  should of been better  towels only changed twice  th shower gel wasn’t changed all week. Food quality was ok  overall was great value for money so happy

7877723,Flight was delayed 2 hours. Plane got swapped from TUI plane to a Wamos plane. There was no drink and food facilities. The plane was very dirty and old. I certainly won't be flying with yourselves again
7877736,I believed I had booked a side or sea view room. It was evident in conversation with the hotel before our arrival that this was not the case. Querying it with with TUI was unsatisfactory and the room we were allocated was disappointing and overpriced giv
7877743,The Flight was delayed by approx. 1 hour. Don't know why  think it was a technical issues before the plane arrived. The experience on board and during the flight was pleasant and relaxing  staff were great  friendly and polite. At the destination the kno

7877751,Booking was fairly easy. Flights were good and on time.
7877760,The flight out had no entertainment  not even a screen showing where we were geographically and couldn’t hear the captain speaking. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff welcoming and friendly. The food was well varied every meal time even when we 
7877767,Our holiday to Cape Verde went very smoothly apart from a few hiccups at Bristol Airport concerning the lift having broken down  very relaxing holiday.
7877773,Everything went very well  even travelling with our autistic child  helpful people at airport and check in
7877776,Me and my family had an awesome time in Menorca hotel was very clean and the food was excellent different choices of food which was awesome as my little kids are fussy eaters I will be back next year and the staff were polite and very helpful
7877798,Overall the experience was very good  although the flight was a Norwegian flight so any credit here would be down to them. The only thing that let the holiday down was our room which we are very disappointed about.
7877801,All went extremely well. Flight  transfer  hotel check in  room. Also home ward bound went very well. Please explain why we do online check in but  still have to queue at check in desk at East Mid' Airport - no baggage drop of. The whole Holiday was perf
7877812,The overall service offered by Tui was very good. I find the booking options to be clear and informative. The transfers from the airport to the hotel were easy and without hassle  making the holiday enjoyable from the start.
7877824,Airport experience
7877836,We took a flight only. Outbound it was delayed 3 hours but we were given no notice of this. You knew in advance but didn't bother to email us to earn us
7877840,friendly staff who tried to answer any of our queries. they made thenselves known at the airport and guided us accordingly.
7877849,Very helpful check in and cabin staff. Route display on flight great idea. Pity it wasn't on return journey. Boarding would be much quicker if the people at the rear of the plane went on first and those nearest the front went on last. This would then sto
7877864,We have been on many tui cruises. The staff are exceptional very hard working and polite. One trip in Gibralter was poor value. The guide needed to be more presentable and not show up in dirty trousers.also herushed the tour. it did not help the fact it

7877885,Second time at same hotel. Reception staff and your rep Jesson were rude.
7877895,The transitions provided were smooth (buses etc) and times were clearly explained on the notice board. However the hotel didn’t quite live up to expectations and the trips offered were a rip-off. We found much cheaper prices for the same trips independen
7877897,Our hotel reps were really friendly and helpful. The hotel transfers could have been improved  as we were waiting at the airport for an hour for the bus to be filled. On the way back it took longer as we went
7877898,Good holiday. Reps bit disorganised on landing directing to transfer (privately paid). Also would of liked more detail and advice on rooms at hotel as due to lack of info had to upgrade which cost extra. Small things really overall very good.
7877900,Getting people onto the flight was a nightmare... missed flight spot and had to wait 75 minutes...
7877908,Not loose our luggage !!
7877910,As usual all was good  straightforward easy transfers to and from resort. Good availability if the rep at resort  although she could have been more knowledgable about walks etc.
7877911,Every thing went well no problems
7877914,The only time we saw a tui rep was in the airport on the way home . We may as well have been traveling with Ryanair .The service on the flight was very poor and extremely slow. We sat in prebooked seats having paid extra for these row 16 and it took over
7877920,The staff on Thomson Spirit really made our holiday  especially our waiters and wine waiter. They are so friendly and helpful. Unfortunately  our itinerary was changed and we could not visit Porto and Lisbon. We appreciate that passenger safety is the pr

7877976,Entertainment good shows waiter service restaurant very slow service 2 hours for 2 people snack Shack was awful no chicken no fish like on Discovery
7877977,There was an exit tax we were not made aware of. It felt like there was lots of additional charges. However staff were lovely never been on a airline with better or more polite staff/air hostesses included

7878068,When my wife was admitted to a hospital 40 Miles from our resort for 3days I stayed with her. I asked my son who remained in our hotel to ask the Tui rep in our hotel to phone me. He declined to contact me at the hospital when all I wanted to ask him som

7878077,Good
7878088,Every thing was good. Hotel food. Rooms one of the best hotels I've stoo
7878094,Booking on the website was carried out with consummate ease.. The choices presented were of a good quality and allowed an informed decision. The organisation at the airport at both ends was as good as we've known it to be. The hotel received us very well
7878118,It would be nice to have up date photos of the hotel. As one of the reason we booked here was the gym. Which is nothing like in the photos
7878119,Everything ran very smoothly on the way there couldn’t fault it. Only thing I would say is that the return transfers to the airport took over 2 hours as there was so many pickups where as the one going only took about an hour
7878120,Our holiday was fantastic  such friends and helpful staff all around. The TUI introduction meeting could have been a bit better  in terms of we left not sure which trip did what.. but when we went to the desk to speak to the other TUI Rep he explained it
7878125,Service was very good from the first choice reps at the hotel
7878137,Over all good experience
7878138,Very disappointed. Our first cruise and probably our last. Staff were very friendly and accommodation adequate  but my perception of cruising was that there would be an element of 'luxury'  despite the very competitive pricing! The food was terrible (sav
7878146,Very disappointed with TUI. Our hotel was advertised as on a beautiful Caribbean beach however we weren't informed that the beach was unusable due to the extreme seaweed problem in the area. We were miss-sold this hotel by TUI.
7878149,Good rep and have previously had great experiences with TUI hence the reason why rebooking with this company  however I feel the holiday was very much oversold compared to the experience. Staff were rude and unhelpful. For example  the first evening we s

7878156,great food
7878169,hotel   food  location etc brilliant  adults only was great. I had to pay £50 to add Timothy's middle name  that is not a fair charge. I have been a customer for many years with no recognition .
7878171,There have been problems with previous bookings which have already been communicated. You're having to build the trust up again !!
7878182,Always had good service and holiday as described.
7878187,Lovely holiday good service overall enjoyed it
7878189,Seemless the whole process

7878193,It is very hard not to like the Cape Verde people  and the staff at the Sensimar Cabo Verde didn't disappoint. However  considering this was advertised as a 5T (*?) adults only hotel  we were expecting a relaxing experience. The hotel was  however  very

7878199,Good flights  great reps and good excursion plus all inclusivemakes it fantastic. Beach and swimming pool sun beds always available. RUI hotels are true 4 star with excellent staff. Cape Verde in November pretty much guaratees sunshine.
7878205,Wonderful hotel and staff very friendly and helpful didn’t get to meet the TUI rep as they didn’t turn up!
7878211,The hotel has gone down in standard and needs a refurb. We had to have the water/bath fixed 3 days and it still wasn’t great. It was our honeymoon so did spoil it a little. The staff was great  friendly and attentive. The tui staff we only saw once throu

7878226,Pleasant experience from start to finish. No problems encountered  team at airport were very friendly and informative.
7878231,The website is sometimes slow to load and update with live availability especially when trying to book last minute. Flight was good both ways  staff are friendly at check in and on the flight.
7878232,Our flight back was delayed by an hour. Then we arrived in Manchester we were still on the plane for nearly an hour before we were able to leave the plane. What I found frustrating was the lack of communication with the passengers to explain the reason f
7878233,The hotel parco del sole is rated as 4 star which we find very hard to believe given our experience there. The food is not of a great quality  tinned fruit and veg  and not a great selection. The hotel is very dated  riddled with ants  rooms damp  air co

7878242,We booked a flight only and this went very well on both flights. The staff were very helpful and the flight was very punctual. Staff were friendly & courteous
7878245,When youhaving the morning flight  the tui meeting should be the same day not in the next one. Because it ruins your next day... When you would be able to know everything on the same day. The staff was friendly but about the tui day tours they should exp
7878258,Superb resort all round. Breakfast served later into the day and the lobby bar opening earlier would be our only suggestions! Staff were excellent and very knowledgeable of the area!
7878259,Good price for last minute holiday. Good position hotel. TUI rep to deal with issue to resolution needs tobe improved. Price of excursions expensive compared to independent booking with local travel
7878268,Excellent value for money. Hotel ideal for a good quality but economic holiday. On site rep helpful  friendly and knowledgeable. Everything wen well n poblems.
7878269,The holiday was great couldn’t fault it. However once we was been and done tui left us at Manchester airport waiting for our bags over 1 hour. My girlfriend first holiday was ruined when she needed her suit case. Manchester Airport ignored us saying not

7878287,The rep Laura was really knowledgable & helpful.
7878289,Good holiday but my laundry was ruined when I sent it to be laundered. I did not notice until I got to my hotel for the 2nd part of my holiday and now you will not re-imburse me.....even more expense!
7878291,Improvements to be made:- 1. Reps very unhelpful. Only spoke to you if you spoke first. Didn't mix with clients at all. 2. Reception staff in hotel  very unhelpful. When reporting a problem with the shower  told 'Thats how it is  they are all like that^ 
7878301,Tui made the trip to Cyprus very easy.
7878303,Website was easy to navigate  good choice of holidays to choose from. Only bad point  there was no rep to meet us or guide us to the bus. We had to wait around for a while until she appeared.
7878304,We booked a flight only from Birmingham and checked in on line. When we arrived at the airport we were directed to the self check in area. It was pandemonium. The area was small with several 'check in points' crammed in so everyone was getting in everyon
7878310,Flight times
787832,Great value for money. Good selection of accommodation and travel dates available. Brilliant destinations. There was a great service whilst we were away- reps were fantastic and the 24/7 contact availability was really useful.

7878381,Would like to see a rep accompany the transfers to and from the hotel - this is the one time that you would want them on hand in case of any issues.
7878382,We had a brilliant time  apartment was clean and spacious for us and it wasn’t too noisy! We got our money’s worth!
7878385,The location of our room was unacceptable a 10 minute walk to the reception area and main dining and bar areas. My wife has mobility issues which was reflected in the fact that I had booked assistance at the airport. TUI airline managed the assistance is
7878389,All went well  from booking on line  to arriving at Hotel. Could not fault First Choice. And the price was a pleasure as well. I normally book direct with this hotel  First Choice came up 50% cheaper and that included flights and transfers. Superb!!

7878534,Flight there was great - we were on row 4 so had lots of room. I didn't like the fact we weren't able to print our boarding passes earlier though - this made me very anxious as i've never gone to an airport without the passes. Flight back wasn't great bu
7878536,Everything was fine except bath layout. The way it was  not practical. Hooks for towels fitted in front of toilet. Water spread s out when you take shower.There is nothing to hang your clothes & towels near shower
7878548,The travel arrangements were good flying from Norwich. We found the Hotel and Staff very good. There was an excellent choice of food in whichever Restaurant we chose to visit. However we were very disappointed that the No Shorts rule was not enforced in 
7878550,The crew  entertainment and food was all fab. Loved it all.
7878552,Fantastic experience. The staff were friendly and always helpful. The complex was beautiful and spotlessly clean.
7878554,All went very well . Stayed in Thompson Gold  Excellent.
7878559,Check in was good. Cabin crew very helpful and professional. Hotel was ok  but not great. All inclusive food and drinks not worth staying in most evening. We also had a lot of cockroaches in our room. Although the room was fumigated this didn't stop them
7878560,I think First Choice provides good value for money and a good choice of destinations  I have found their selection of accommodation to be of reliable quality.
7878565,Excellent package holiday at a great price  Boarding passes pre printed made checking in easy at Bristol Airport  The plane was nice and clean with reasonably priced food and drinks on the plane  TUI representatives were there to meet us at Tenerife Sout
7878571,Flight and coach transfers were good/organised. Friendly staff and reps. Resort itself was nice with nice pool. However hotels food  drinks and entertainment were poor.
7878574,Meeting new friends on a quite relaxing holiday just as described by TUI.
7878575,Easy to book through the website. We went via the last minute deals section as we wanted a deal and got one so couldn’t be happier especially when the transfers and flights were included which helped take the pressure off finding our own flights and havi
7878586,Great holiday. Could do with an explanation of where to expect my pram when arriving at destination. Stood at luggage carousel for over an hour waiting for it to come out only to find it had been dump at another part of luggage collection.
7878592,Food not as good as on previous visits to this hotel/over cooked and tasteless.
7878595,Very competitively priced holiday
7878596,Check in good flights lots of room clean and tidy not dated. Travel from baggage reclaim to coaches needs improvement
7878598,Lovely holiday no problems great hotel
7878606,Issues with the website not working probably resulted in difficulty booking. Hotel was amazing! The photos didn’t do the hotel justice
7878609,Service before holiday was great. Big safeguarding issues during our holiday which has already been raised and being dealt with

7878615,Hotel  and satff were very nice - just very disappointed to have no mention of the building work going on next door
7878623,Fabulous shows and great excursions/bike tours made this a holiday to remember.
7878628,Everything went very well with the booking and transfers  flights were on time and we had no problem with tui or first choice
7878630,Communication with reps could be improved. Customers should not rely on an app and should have local and immediate communication at any point during their stay. Although trips can be booked online it is unclear where pickup points are. We wanted to book 
7878636,We had problems with the Room they changed at straight away with a Bottle Prosecco  all the Staff are great ?? good food ?? and the best Sea ?? and Beach
7878637,Was more like a 3 star than a 4 star very small and the journey to the beach could have been better. They certainly dont have AC or a clear indication of time to come back. The food was also more of the same. Loved the trip to the 5 star hotel very nice.
7878639,Hotel was really good. They were doing building works which was annoying
7878641,Excellent from start to finish
7878661,Flights on time

7878673,Starting with booking holiday  I felt everything was to be running smoothly and easily. We had no issues with finding help from tui staff. Considering the fact  all of the instructions were clear  no additional questions were needed.
7878680,From start to finish we had no trouble with anything. The flight was on schedule and transfer smooth. The only thing I could criticise was the air conditioning in the room this wasn't very good but apart from that I could not fault the hotel or staff

7878757,Flight was fine both ways. Hotel was ok  a little bit dasappointing at first  staff were all friendly it was more that we were unable to use the facilities at the Protur Safari Hotel whilst our child was over there in Kids club  we were under the impress
7878761,Perfect holiday from the beginning to the end. All the tui staff from the cabin crew to the rep at resort were extremely helpful and very professional. Nothing was a problem. First class service.
7878769,Alice and Terrell were very good at organising activities and keeping everyone informed of events taking place during the day and at night. They bothy made a point of chatting to everyone and created a very inclusive atmosphere. They had activities for a

7878771,This was a last minute booking and we were not sure what to expect  from the moment we checked in at the airport till the time we got home it was the best. The staff who got us onto the busses at Cancun we’re great receptionists very efficient and the al
7878777,the only downside of the holiday was on the last day  we had to be out our room by 12 oclock and our pick up wasnt untill 6.40 pm the only courtesy room was fully booked so we could not have a shower and get changed before we left this put a downer on ou
7878780,Ease of booking  special assistance were very efficient  TUI flight attendants were very helpful  they asked if they could do any more in helping us to our seats as one of my group was disabled  as in not able to walk a great distance. Their service thro
7878786,From the beginning  when I walked into TUI in Stratford  I was reassured and felt confident in what was being discussed. I was given many suggestions from the 3 colleagues I spoke too and also allowed to read over reviews from previous customers. I was a
7878793,only improvement is seatting space on plane - feels very cramped
7878794,Everything it was perfect in this holiday. It was a very small thing that I didn’t enjoy  which was the hotel room that had a bad smell all the time. But because I was in 5 excursions  so I was most of the time away  didn’t affect me very much.
7878795,A late booking but everything went to plan. Smooth flights on a nice new  comfortable plane  easy transfers and a lovely hotel. No negatives.
7878799,Quick and efficient flights and airport experience. Lovely and clean hotel. Food could be improved in hotel  not good quality meat. Staff efficient  however  don’t seem interested in English people  hotel all about German people including food and entert

787882,Reliable service. Polite staff
7878840,Holiday was great. Hotel was wonderful. Delayed flights weren't wonderful. Interestingly  I went online to see if the inbound flight was delayed and it was - by 2 hours. How about not taking us from the hotel if you know we're going to have to sit in a t
7878852,Flights good food quality and drinks poor
7878853,Quickest boarding and ready for take of process I have ever known. Attendants very warm and friendly
7878860,Hi  We recently stayed at Kerkyra golf resort in Corfu and had a fantastic time. The hotel itself and amenities I would say were above average  the staff were friendly and pleasant and the food was nice. However  what made the stay so great were your Tui
7878861,First time at Sirenis  Cala Llonga and have not done an all inclusive anywhere for nearly 10 years. It was an excellent experience for a change and would consider A.I. again as being abroad in Euroland is so expensive to drink and eat out. We are so luck
7878864,Gassed by sewerage transfer every day
7878866,Everything went really well  from the plane leaving on time to the hotel being awesome can't fault it.
7878885,Online booking was simple  but flights with Thomas Cook added s level of confusion especially when trying to contact someone regarding a query
7878886,TUI do a good job with the package holiday. you know what to expect and there are no surprises. The whole experience was good from start to finish and went like clockwork. Flight OK  transfers timely and hotel fine.
7878888,Coach journey unessesarely long

7878903,Hotel was excellent  very clean and as described on your website. The TUI rep in the hotel  Aiden  was excellent  very knowledgeable about the island and helpful when we booked day trip. He was available at the desk every day and very helpful and cheerfu
7878904,Great package holiday with flights  accommodation and transfers included at a good rate. They look after you and would happily book again.
7878928,Hotel absolutely great. Your marketing of the A la carte? Not a big difference to anybody else stopping at the hotel! It was the hotel that made the holiday. Not worth the extra money you mark up
7878930,No info for our pick up time. I text the number that was advertising in the TUI information book. It said I could text! I sent the message and still waiting for a reply!! CRAP SERVICE!
7878931,Nice refit at hotel! Food entertainment & staff all excellent. Weather also better than expected an excellent time had by all
7878934,Almost everything about our holiday was great. The staff were helpful  although they weren't especially friendly or approachable. The choice of all-inclusive drinks was slightly limited and we were only allowed one drink per person with our evening meal 
7878960,Staff were always helpful and smiling. Quality and variety of food in the buffet restaurant was excellent. The hotel was so clean at all times. Kids club - the staff so friendly and kind  our 6 year old really enjoyed the activities. Entertainment was go

7878974,Flight was poor. Hotel was good
7878986,Flight out the seat would not recline and the reading light was broken and would not come on . At the hotel the mattress was worn out with broken springs BUT was quickly replaced with a new memory foam mattress. Food was good and very varied. Evening ent
7878991,Great holiday  good rep & a good airline too. Info was easy to access online with booking & printing necessary info off. It was good to see excursions we could do online & plan for the holiday. Reps abroad are friendly too  making you feel safe
7878992,Lovely hotel  lovely staff.
7878993,I paid you for a holiday that you really wasn’t even involved in when we landed we was put on the bus with a spainish driver that could not speak English no rep it was meant to be a 60 min transfer that took nearly 3 hours had to just look at hotel names
7878998,Lovely experience from start to finish staff very helpful and friendly
7879001,Every thing went good on my holiday to Mexico went premium class which I try to do on long haul holidays cant find fault with anything from check in till I returned. Would be nice to have access to lounge on return airport .
7879009,The seats on the plane were very cramped flying out  especially with a large man next to me and a toddler on my lap. Luckily we had a spare seat on the return journey which was much better. Transfers were ok although us and fellow guests were a bit unsur
7879014,No rep in hotel at all  wasn't told this by anyone. When we did email about a trip it took 36 hours to get back to us. Felt dumped. Have used tui for years but will think twice in future.
7879029,Reps all friendly and helpful. Great room for the price. Sometimes a rep may have taken a while to be around the hotel but would be there each day.
7879032,Having had the problem of drone interference from Gatwick  we flew on the 27th December with no problems at all  flight on time leaving and arriving. Arrived at Tenerife South by Tui rep and directed to mini bus to take us to hotel. We stayed at Guayarmi
7879048,Another great holiday at cinco plaza. The entertainment team are fantastic.
7879055,Hotel die congressi was fabulous. Staff there very helpful. Lovely big room and balcony. Husband coeliac and they accommodated his gluten free diet brilliantly. Actual area Castlemare di Stabia bit of a dump but railway station well placed for travel to 
7879060,Hi The resort and arrival transfer was great. Food on the plane was cold but we hit turbulence so I guess it couldn't be reheated. The score is only an 8 as the return transfer was unorganized  chaotic and nobody knew which bus to get on. They didn't hav
7879061,This is the 6th HV holiday we have been on having previously stayed at HV Majorca 4 times and Lanzarote once. Overall  very enjoyable a few minor issues on site managed by reservations. Main issue  totally unacceptable service for the VIP Airport experie
7879083,Informative  helpful staff. Rep went out of his way at airport to get my kindle returned to me when I left it on the plane. I don’t personally like the hard sell on trips  especially when the meeting is early the day after landing following a long haul f
7879096,The price of the holiday was excellent but the accommodation on arrival we were given a room where in the bathroom we found a pool of water. Their response was in the morning to put down towels not very efficient and finally after 5 days of our holidays 
7879099,Easy booking system Lots of choice of holiday Good rating system on Holidays Good and accurate pictures for hotel Lots of reviews to read Choice of excursions to book Helpful customer service line when I had a query
78791,"fast, efficient, and proffessional. Always there to help. Great knowledge advice and tips. Friendly, approachable and great prices."
7879104,Fabulous hotel and staff. Nothing was too much trouble.
7879109,Nice hotel for a total relax and unwind holiday. Buffet food caters for all tastes. Hotel entertainment a bit dull of an evening but only real let down for us was that there was nowhere to walk to for a stroll as it us remote.
7879111,Efficient check in at the airport and quick transfer to resort. SENSATORI TUI staff at hotel very helpful
7879114,Excellent experience from start to finish  from the TUI reps to each individual member of staff at the hotel. Holiday from the very beginning was well organised and the Sensatori hotel was exceptional although the photos on the website do not do it justi
7879117,I wish to raise a complaint . 1. TUI representatives at the Airport were more occupied with their make up and chatting than with customers. 2. The Karbel Hotel was terrible. We arrived at the room & there was faeces spots on the sheets  blood on the cove
7879122,The hotel management did not seem to have customer interests at heart as they did not have enough staff in the hotel which annoyed a number of guests and meant service was slow.
7879124,Holiday location and experience was fine in terms of us going around and doing what we went to Gran Canaria to do. But the service from TUI was below average in my opinion. The way there. I felt rushed through to the plane  the flight attendants didn't l
7879140,I can honestly say nothing need improvement every question or worry I had was answered and left me reinsured   I'm definitely booking with TUI from now one.
7879141,Everything about tui was good flight was smooth pilot was awesome communication throughout the flight there and back.
7879142,Hotel was a bit tired compared to previous RIU ones I’ve visited. Food excellent   great choice in the buffet   excellent in Sir George but spoilt by erratic service. Pool needed tiles fixing . Entertainment excellent. Flights good   Dreamliner always ha
7879144,The holiday overall was good  but more communication from the TUI staff and Reps would of been good in respects of our flights  which were delayed on the outbound and inbound flights. Bristol Airports Website  knew the flights were going to be delayed  b
7879151,I’ve travelled with Tui before and feel confident that it will run smoothly. The excursions are usually very good also
7879154,We would have liked to be told that a scene holiday was for youngster
7879158,Very well described holiday. Would be better if it were cheaper during school holiday periods.
7879162,Journey both ways were good. Hotel was good but lacked coordination. Rep was new to the area and was not well versed in what was available.
7879164,5kg hand luggage is probably one of the worst allowances! Long check in queues and a delay of 45mins - not a great start.
7879169,catalogue of things that we were unhappy with. Paying extra to select seats of your choice then finding out you don't allow booking of middle and aisle seats together  made a complaint - nothing! Arrived at airport  sat on transfer bus for more than 30 m
7879178,The transfer from the hotel was smooth and the reps came onto the bus to let us know what was happening. The reps onsite were easy to find should you have a problem as they were situated in the hotel foyer and the welcome meeting very informative
7879179,everything went well in resort. and transfers. Flight delayed 2 hours twenty minutes inbound. so that spoilt it. wpuld of preffered to have stayed in hotel.Longer  as the airport very expensive for food and drinks
7879182,Everything was 10/10 apart from the rubbish and debris between the hotel and beach. For a protected turtle nesting ground this is very dissapointing rspecially as we had a tui show concerning how we all need to do more in view of the problem. You just ca
7879185,I have been a regular customer of Thomson/Tui for years however I have noticed that I’ve not been able to sit with my party unless I pay for seats in advanced. This has how happened on the last two holidays booked with Tui this year.
7879187,Good flight times Poor communication in resort re departues
7879191,Easy check in and boarding
7879193,Online booking- we found the holiday easy to find. However the website was having difficulties  so it didn’t always save our details  meaning that we had consequential problems with the requested vegan meal on the outbound flight. We were also a little c
7879194,Hotel accommodation was good and food was good. Very long queues at Ghania airport on return journey was not good.
7879197,The hotel was fabulous and the TUI rep very helpful and friendly. We went Ona trip with tui and everything was great. Had no issues at all
7879198,TUI has a deserved excellent reputation. In spite of a slight delay on my flight caused by debris on Gatwick's runway  I felt I was always kept informed. The ground and on board staff have been professional and kind when welcoming travellers on board  sh
7879199,This was our 4th cruise with Marella and we have had many Thomson holidays in the past. It was our first time on the Dream and we loved it. The same high standards in all departments of the ship. Just keep doing what you do!
7879201,Our holiday was great and everything was organised very well. The only thing I would improve is the organisation of meetings with the TUI rep who covered tourists from the UK and Ireland in the RIU Garoe hotel. We arrived very late at night (2 am) to the
7879206,This holiday was truly amazing  although we were delayed and arrived very late we were treated extremely well by all the hotel staff. From the time we set foot in the Olympic Lagoon there was nothing we could fault. The rep  Victoria  was very informativ
7879216,Holiday was a great experience from start to finish. the app provided excellent guidance and information. The arrangements went perfectly and the rep was a great help in terms of local info and hotel information. hotel and park are beautiful. Woulbnt hes
7879226,Process of booking was easy  emails kept up to date with check in and extras. Flight was comfortable and on time although was issues onboard with the toilets on both legs of the journey. Resort was as expected and staff friendly.
787923,"Easy booking, constant reminders"
7879230,The hotel was lovely   but the only thing   one plug socket in room  my one and only thing I was not happy with.
7879240,Photographs on the Tui gallery were not representative to reality of the hotel conditions and standards. Our room was small and smelled damp and musty  furnishings were basic and dated  ants were present in the room  bathroom was old and dated with suspe
7879252,Customer service needs improving. It’s often difficult to get through
7879253,The holiday was as described online and we enjoyed the hotel and the resort. All the travel arrangements went well and having the phone app was useful to find out pick-up times and resort info.
7879257,Hotel staff friendly  especially to children although we didn't have any. Wish the children's entertainment and adults were separate as couldn t hear it. Once half way through our room was made into a double instead of twin but this was corrected. Terrac
7879259,Communication from the coach driver could have been clearer  didn’t check of the names of customers wasn’t going to allow us on the coach
7879266,Apart from having to check your own bags in which I think is disgusting the rest went well
7879277,This is the first time we have used Tui and the flights were really excellent. The Dreamliner is an awesome aircraft  so quiet and the staff were amazing. We always fly with Virgin into Orlando at least twice a year but I think we have made the decision 
7879283,We had a great holiday  great weather and a fantastic hotel been to this hotel before and will go again
7879284,The best experience  from booking to the first day or the holiday to the last! A good plus is the app  its great gives you detailed information and very user friendly. The staff were amazing at the hotel  made the whole week a much better experience  I w
7879291,We loved our holiday  hotel was great staff very friendly and efficient. Great location.
7879292,Everything was brilliant from the flight to hotel stay couldnt have hasked for anything better. Will be booking up again very shortly.
7879295,We were held up for over an hour once we had boarded the plane on the grounds that there was fog at our destination airport   surely that information was available so we could have stayed in the airport in less cramped conditions  not a good start...…..
7879301,Holiday was perfect and orgenised  until I landed and went to drive out my car park which I paid for with TUI and got charged £165 for called 24/7 geting rudely blown of phone and having to pay this. Currently disputing it but put a absolute downer and e

7879335,Hi  my family and me had a lovely time at H10 Lanzarote garden fantastic hotel. Staff at Tui are all nice and friendly are flight was good and went really well. The one thing that was not good was finding out we didn't have any reps from Tui to breve us

7879364,The hotel was perfectly set up of children which is what we wanted for our 3 year old boy. Both the big pool and splash pool with slides were great. The staff at the kids club were generally really good although we had one experience where we had to talk
7879367,Not at all happy with TUI resort rep. We asked for an upgrade in room  and offered to pay for such  we then requested a change of hotel  again offered to pay for such  within exiting hotel group. - both requests refused  with Rep stating this was hotel c
7879377,Very good
7879379,The only thing that could of been better would be more staff at the entrance of the dining room's. Lots of people would rush in with children and not bother to sanitize their hands. Some of the guests would spoon the chocolate fountain in to their big fa
7879383,A lot was good  but a near death experience due to poor maintenance wasn't so good.
7879389,We were really pleased with everything about our holiday and flights we would defiantly use Tui again in the future and recommend where we stayed to friends and relatives in the future. All in all Tui is a very good airline to travel with
7879396,Booking was really easy and with all the information we required for the holiday sent in plenty of time. Once on holiday we awaited the rep to arrive for our welcome meeting for nearly half an hour after the time given for the meeting. No apology was giv

7879401,Hotel entertainment
7879406,The holiday was booked online  the TUI website was easy to navigate & we had no problems - we normally go to the TUI shop in Swansea as the staff are so friendly  helpful & knowledgeable especially Emma who booked our previous and next holiday. The staff

7879411,The hotel and the holiday were fine. Where it went wrong was when we arrived at Alicante airport to depart. The Tui staff set out the queueing lines incorrectly causing confusion and frustration. Not one member of staff played a leadership role and the s
7879412,Overall acceptable holiday let down by an issue we had with the some other guest that where threatened us with violence and held us hostage in our room after we complained about the noise level of them screaming and shouting at all hours of the night. Th
7879417,Holiday was as we would have expected  good standard of hotel  transfers ran smooth  our rep was informative; we booked an excursion (catamaran) via the rep which was very good and the she also gave us advice about a trip we wanted to take to Fuerteventu
7879418,Booking process and getting there all went well.
7879429,Our holiday was excellent. Flights and flight crew perfect. However the facilities at Edinburgh airport were poor. The boarding arrangements at Edinburgh Airport were shambolic. It was like herding sheep. Passengers were called forward based on seat numb
7879436,Your web site is really poor. It didn’t work and the boarding passes were hidden under random headings and useless.

7879454,On this holiday everything went well. The hotel is not a four star hotel but it's very clean and the staff and food and entertainment was great. Unfortunately last year we went on a two weeks honeymoon to Costa Rica at riu guanacaste. That was awefull   
787946,Very well organized from start to finish
7879463,All staff very polite and helpful. Good amount of legroom. Good selection of food and drink. Not enough toilets in economy for us to use.
7879469,Easy to book on line  we were kept up to date with emails and the whole experience was straight forward and went to plan
7879471,A very rude flight attendant named Jaqui on our outward flight came as a surprise. We have never experienced this hence why we feel the need to bring it to your attention. She clearly did not want to be working on Boxing Day and made it very obvious. All
7879479,Cabins flooded within an hour of arriving on our first ever cruise. Utterly devestated and initially very upset with Tui however over course of the week blown away by effort to make it right with us. Excellent staff morale and kindness shown from all on

7879495,The hotel we stayed in was in my opinion not up to the usual first choice standard by any means. Sadly we never saw the first choice rep only the kids club reps during our stay
7879497,On the flight coming home the young lady sitting next to me was diabetic and due to the rush and heat. She started to feel unwell before we took off I explained to the air hostess a lad. He told me there was nothing he could do i asked if he had a biscui
7879525,I would recommend First Choice/ Tui. The website is very easy to navigate and easy to filter. The resort staff are very helpful also. They were friendly and approachable and always happy to assist. I think it could be made clearer what needs to be done b
7879526,For our onwards journey  while going for online check in  the system did not allow and we contacted TUI office for online check in. We were told that TUI does not do online checkin. We have to reach airport two hours prior to departure. The flight was on
7879528,everything went very smoothly...from flights  to transfer and holidays
7879529,Staff were excellent made our holiday to be honest. Ana and Joaquin were excellent with our 18 month old son. Hotel was very clean and the food was good. Tui reps also excellent and got everyone involved with the entertainment. Would recommend to a frien
7879530,I can not think of anything that could have improved my holiday with TUI. It was truly fantastic from start to finish! Our first family holiday travelling with our 2 year old was so stress free! Great entertainment for the whole family and completely des

7879536,TUI booking process was incredible easy as always. Reserving seats in advanced meant i was able to sit next to my partner on the flight for the first time in years! TUI app made it easy to access all information at my finger tips both in the UK and in Mo
7879544,Overall  a good holiday. The Airport Lounge at LGW allowed a great start to the holiday however the Premium Check In experience could be improved  as the customer service wasn’t consistent with the rest of the holiday. Great flight crew and TUI transfers
7879548,flight taking of on time
7879549,Booking online was easy  with everything included from luggage to transfers. However  us along with many others were directed wrong by TUI staff to our transfer causing a lot of disruption. Also  we were extremely disappointed in our hotel as it was fals
7879556,Decent three star but the food was often cold and it made me ill on final night. Nightmare journey home.
7879559,The hotel is good  but the food could be better! The location is beautiful clean and well maintained. The view from the hotel is stunning! The biggest downside is the local bus service! Why can’t they get a bus stop nearer the hotel and nearer the bulk o
7879560,We did not book a holiday with TUI but did book a return flight. The checking in process at Gatwick took over an hour and our return jouney proved to be little better with the same amount of time being taken to check in.
7879565,Good all round. We mainly book with TUI.
7879570,Crew very professinoal and friendly  great selection of entertainment on flight. Food is above average compared to other flight companies. Would definitely go with TUI again.
7879573,Loved it from start to end  great accommodation  fantastic food & opportunities for activities. Staff all very helpful & some excellent.
7879579,Cabin was superb and the cabin steward really looked after it food and drinks were very good and the entertainment in the broadwsy lounge was superb.The ports visited were exeptional and the scenery was locely .Staff were very polite and couldnt do enoug
7879598,Free WiFi on plane out was v good. Hotel good as usual. Hotel check-in for return flight useless as bus pick up was 3 hrs before flight  so no extra time at hotel - we told rep we would keep cases for normal transfer.
7879606,The flight and the hotel were great  with no complaints whatsoever. The staff at the hotel really understand what customer service is all about. Nothing was too much trouble.
7879609,Only problem was NO PICK UP to take us to the airport for return flight. Got to pick up area half an hour before and no coach turned up. Waited for 3/4 hour after pick up time and then got a taxi. NOT IMPRESSED & will be complaining. The rest of the holi
7879612,The aeroplane was great with movies. The website was impossible and rubbish.
7879617,Nice flight and effective customer service .
7879621,The flight  transfers  hotel reps and even the pilot on the flight home were all first class. It helped make a great holiday
7879629,Mostly everything was good or very good. Reclining seats should be removed from all planes  there’s no need for them  and flights that are over 6 hours aren’t short haul in my opinion so there should be seat back TVs. The hotel was very good. One of our 
787963,Hotel not to normal standard for rating
7879630,Flights and transfers were fine. Hotel was relatively clean but with a few minor faults. Fire alarm was activated on numerous occasions meaning numerous evacuations to reception to find they were false alarms. Balcony door would not lock and a couple of 
7879640,The rep was superb A really helpful  a great familiarising free walk on the 1st morning and great with recommending trips. Flights etc all went really smoothly  and staff were pleasant at every turn
7879656,We had a serious issue on arrival at our accommodation in that the room description we booked (1 Bedroom Apartment with Terrace and Sauna) was duplex-style  ie: on two levels  which was completely unsuitable for our young family. The photo when booking c
7879660,Was a really lovely place to go  would definitely go back again and recommend it to friends and family.
7879676,The pilot landing in last Wednesdays gales 19/9/18 was fantastic. Please expand to future customers the length of the tfr to the airport. Over 2 hrs is too long. Please be specific so choices can be made on facts.
7879680,Flights were good  we didnt pay to sit together as saving money for more Tui holidays but we only got split across the aisle so that was good. Rep was very good. Hotel lovely.
7879688,Everything was ideal and made the holiday run smooth. From flights to connecting with transportation  lovely clean and modern hotel and friendly nd staff.
7879695,Fab hotel  food  accommodation staff made our holiday one to remember .flight was excellent ??the cabin staff were very attentive serving drinks duty free and a nice choice of food  looking foward to our next holiday with you
7879696,we were happy with the flyt but the food was hard
7879697,Easy to use website and easy to book.
7879698,Hotel was excellent. Reps were good  transfers were punctual. No complaints at all.
7879710,Very good flight. The flight was on time and arrive before time. The landing was very smooth. Love it!
7879711,I only booked a one way flight with TIU  from Naples to Bournemouth on oct 5th. The flight boarded apprix an hour late. Once boarded  the pilot clearly explained the reason for the delay (his flight the night before arrived late so he was not allowed to 
7879721,The flight went well and the staff were friendly. It was easy to find the TUI rep after baggage and be directed to the bus transfer. The transfer was over 2 hours to the hotel  this been 30 mins longer than necessary due to taking the rep home. The bus d

7879730,we had a great holiday. Food  in particular  was the best we have experienced in an all inclusive hotel. Check in was by far the easiest and I was very pleased to see a hotel that was able to accommodate guests with all abilities. I not been to a hotel b
7879738,happy with my holiday not impressed by airplane service
7879740,the crew was very professional .
7879753,We loved the experience from start to finish. The reps  transfers and hotel exceeded our expectations. We did not read enough about the hotel before hand but were pleasantly surprised to see that it was a large family hotel which was perfectly matched fo
7879764,Flight times were great and punctual but no online check in again. Last time I flew it was the same. You could make life so much easier for yourselves
7879770,All staff throughout our journey were great  especially the entertainers at the hotel. Coach transfers on the way back picked us up in plenty of time and went quick. The driver helped us in and out with our luggage with a smile  he also helped us put our
7879781,Very good
7879782,Length of transfer was much to long. Larger beer glasses. Had a great holiday food was great and lovely and hot. it was varied plenty of choice. Lovely room. Very clean.
7879785,the prices were reasonable cheap  easy to book  no delays  flight landed smoothly  very comfortable
7879786,Everything met expectations
7879787,Everything about the holiday was excellent and we would certainly use first choice again and return to the same resort again. All staff at first choice and at the hotel were excellent and made the holiday a special one for us both. The only downside was 
7879788,No problems anywhere
7879794,Easy to use site and good to manage a shortlist of selections before booking. Very helpful local rep for our stay and a wonderful holiday had. Really rate the hotel and the platinum experience. It would be helpful to know more about the differences betwe
7879800,Really enjoyed the holiday  the room was a good size and while not luxurious it was clean  though it was disappointing that the description of the hotel said all rooms had a sea view. We were on the ground floor overlooking a car park so we didn’t make a
7879802,The website was slow  and instead of saying ‘there is a problem  please phone or call into store’  actually tell us there are no holidays or flights left.
7879820,Great service all round.
7879836,Very smooth flight  great entertainment and more or less on time
7879837,The rating on the hotel is not at all what I would expect of a tui / first choice 4* hotel. As a brand that prides itself on quality this hotel was sadly a let down for the expectations of your brand. It was tired  broken sun beds  needed some attention 
7879838,No issues
7879846,Our seats were booked altogether which put my mind at ease on check in  having 3 young children. I have also left a detailed review with the hotel directly.
7879854,Flight times could of been better
7879858,Unable to check in on line or complete api. Too long to queue on the phone and once through call operative cut my call off!! Went into tui at sixfields northampton...again appaling customer service..no effort made to assist
7879861,Had to wait over an hour for another flight to land before our coach transfer left the airport. Had we been advised that there would be a wait we could have booked a private transfer or had a cup of coffee.
7879864,The rep who travelled with us to resort was extremely odd. She focused on the Benidorm passengers  and her appearance was shocking
7879870,Really easy to book holiday using your website including being able to select different flights so maximise the time away.. Lots of information and reminders shared via the e-mails sent.
7879872,We had a lovely holiday  flights were on time  staff at resort couldn't have been more helpful. The resort was closing the day we left and although we had paid for a late checkout the hotel had offered a free late checkout to everybody staying. Without q
7879876,relaxing holiday from start to finish - from the smooth flight  friendly cabin crew. Easy transfer to hotel  warm welcome at hotel  a very easy holiday with no dramas  everything taken care if
7879877,Good price and service
7879880,The whole package  staff helpful  From booking  To airport  To transfers  To holidaying more can I say except we will use TUI again and again
7879884,Quick check in time  well organised.
7879885,When on a late night flight be able to keep your room
7879899,Good hotel very helpful staff. However  we paid £574 board upgrade for half board which equates to approximately 646€. We only received 35€ each per day ie 70€ in total. For a week that equals 490€. we are irritated that you have taken 156€
7879913,Verry good copmany
7879918,Our welcome meeting (delivered by Joey  at the Riu Karanboa  Boa Vista) was very informative and delivered in a professional and enthusiastic manner. From this meeting we were able to book some great excursions that we thoroughly enjoyed. Joey's last day
7879926,Having been on our first ever TUI flight we were suitably impressed from the arriving at the airport to going through immigration at East Midlands
7879928,Great experience
7879934,very good holiday
7879947,Purchased a flight only and all staff I came into contact with were very helpful and friendly.
7879949,Hand baggage allowance on board the flight is too restrictive. No check in on line of for the return flight is very inconvenient. Requirement to be at the airport 2.5 hours prior to departure is excessive.
7879965,Price quality and ease of booking. Excellent reps on site. Good leg room on flights. Quality hotels and services. This is my second booking of the year with Thomson/first choice and I really can't fault them with anything. Really enjoyable relaxed breaks
7879970,The hotel is defo not a 4*. Food was cold entire week. Bed sheets not changed even tho a cup of coffee was spilt all on it. Bathroom cleaned and beds made everyday day (apart from a wed) Floor never swept or mopped Balcony never swept or mopped No lights
7879971,We paid to pre book seats which we couldn't do we were sat with our children anyway so not sure why we had to pay to do this. We couldn't choose to sit anywhere else.
7879978,I am not the intended person for these emails. I have called the store twice to explain. I had access to someone else’s details  address and phone number. I also knew that their house was empty as they were on holiday! This is a massive breach in data pr
7879980,Check in smooth and flight arrived on top. Hand luggage weight needs to be increased.
7879983,Main positive points: flights departed on time  transfer was smooth and very well coordinated on all ends. Hotel was clean and exactly what I expected with great food and a great pool  as well as good walking distance to nearby beaches. Only downside was
7879985,The whole holiday was fabulous! The Falesia is an amazing hotel  with great rooms  superb food and fantastic  warm and friendly staff. The entertainment provided by the Tui Gold reps was great. It was an absolute pleasure to see Harry Hinchcliffe again  
7879987,Hotel in good position. Staff very good. Food Luke warm and plates were cold. When entertainment went inside you could not hear the singers because talking around the bar. Lifts small

7880031,Charlie the representative was excellent  the best we ever had. Trips expensive compared to local market. Local trips were very good
7880032,Absolutely fantastic time from start to finish. Great flights   hotels and transfers.
7880046,On board entertainment it's a long flight
7880051,Overall very good. Leg room on plane is very limited and having paid extra to book seats together  online seat selector would not let me select an aisle seat which left a window seat empty. Felt was
7880069,The holiday was okay but let's be honest this is a good 4 star hotel not a 5 star one.
7880071,Lovely accomodation but resort was disapointing as there were very few restsurants. Apartment staff were very friendly and helpful. Only complaint was that we were not able to get a late chevk out room when we had a late flight back to UK. We were happy 
7880083,Hotel moved us to a different hotel. We had no local contact to sort it out. We emailed but took days to get a reply - we had sorted it out ourselves by then. We were advised that the rep would come and see our room but never showed up. We were disappoin
7880087,Booking on line was easy  especially using a mobile device. The airline staff were very friendly and helpful and assisted me when my partner felt unwell during the flight home.The hotel wad vaulue for money and exceeded our expectations. A very clean hot
7880088,Great holiday  lovely hotel staff helpful and friendly and entertainment was fantastic.
7880089,We stayed at Port Benidorm hotel in Benidorm. The hotel room and amenities were good  as was the service and cleaning. Food repetition however was the one downfall. Breakfast was reasonably good standard apart from having no decent jams. It was all in ti
7880090,Perfect holiday hotel and food amazing.
7880096,Easy process
7880118,Value for money holidays with good choice of local airports. Knowledgeable staff in resort.
7880119,Inform customers when there is a delay in boarding instead of being kept standing in a cold  wet corridor for 45 mins. We had passed through the gate so was unable to go back to sit down  no idea why we were kept waiting until we had boarded the plane to
7880127,We found the staff in the store very helpful and we booked the holiday online which was a very easy process. The only issue we had was due to the low number of UK guests at our hotel the rep didn't visit however she did eventually answer my email. Every 
7880136,The hotel description was accurate so we knew exactly what to expect when we arrived. The Tui rep was very helpful and organised our boat trip.
7880142,Got back from Hols to find our child has hand  foot and mouth virus. Symptoms started on Wed and as this has a 3 day onset we believe he got it from the water park connected with the hotel. We stayed in the hotel Polynesia in Benalmadema. Not a good end 
7880143,Only thing I would not recommend are the seat space  you have to upgrade to get a half decent seat.
7880149,Booking was very easy  website responsive The booking of flight extras was hare this time  as was flying with Thomas Cook and I was passed from TUI to Thomas Cook to their 3rd Party - tenacity and determination was needed to get what I wanted. Transfers 
7880152,The hotel staff were excellent. They were very friendly and extremely helpful. The foood was fantastic and the rooms were spacious  well ventilated and clean.
7880162,The ladies at my local TUI branch in Witney are all fabulous making the booking experience really easy and pleasurable  I know the resort and the hotel really well so I did not require any in resort assistance  the flight home was delayed 2 hours but not
788018,"very little contact before we went on our holiday, despite us booking a year in advance. lots of problems with reference numbers, online log-ins and atoll certificate would not work/print. lack of support when trying to get basic details emailed to us and last minute call reminders. when our holiday was sold to us, the lack of detail provided was unacceptable. wifi and safe had to be paid for on arrival and the overall holiday was not as was explained to us i.e. not fully all inclusive and the extras we paid for i.e. sea view was not at all a 'sea' view, rather a jungle view. we will not be traveling via Thomson or first choice in the future."
7880181,Long delay due to inefficient staff and systems.. Being treated by condescending flight staff unable to tell the truth. Using customer hysteria to excuse operational failures. Treating customers as unthinking morons rather than reasoning adults.
7880184,Nothing
7880185,Everything thing went well  fantastic first family holiday with our baby daughter. Flying by Dreamliner was particularly useful with a baby and all members of staff were approachable and helpful.
7880186,This was a flight only trip. The flight was better than expected. Felt well looked after. Food was great and movie choice. What I didn't like was the horrendously long queue on arrival at Sanford passport control.
7880188,Fantastic holiday  flight going was perfect....flight back at 00:45 from dalaman to Aberdeen very stressful indeed. Hundreds of people in lines to check in. We only wanted to drop bags as we already had boarding passes.... this seemed unavailable. We wer
7880203,Flight staff were excellent accomdation was worth what i paid absolutely enjoyed
7880209,Everything went well on the vacation but it was a simple package holiday with no special requirements. Previous experience has shown that when special services are requested Tui can fail to deliver an efficient service.
7880210,The luggage allowance was less than I’m used to. The return flight  what with having to vacate the room at 1100hrs and then arrival at Gatwick at 2200hrs was tiring and not ideal. The hotel was a good standard but I’m sure that you are aware that most we
7880216,Transfer to hotel was good and greeting on arrival
7880222,Entertainment was top -notch. Boarding could have been better  Celebrity pick up cases from your car.
7880231,Firstly the overall price of my flights was very reasonable and I have no cause for complaint. I believe the 5kg limit for hand luggage is too low. Also its not very clear if a ladys handbag is classed as 1 unit of hand luggage  people with children need
7880234,We loved every part of this holiday  the Hotel was amazing and we could not fault any part of our stay there. The private transfer was very well organised considerably better than a coach transfer. In general the whole holiday was fantastic and we would 
7880236,Great hotel  lovely food and all staff friendly.
7880238,Everything was excellent as usual with the hotel and flight. Very good value!! Very disappointed that TUI are stopping the Birmingham flight to Goa!!!!!
7880249,the accommodation was excellent  the flight was pretty good  food acceptable on the plane  although cost of beverages was pretty steep for what you got. Destination didn't disappoint... However the TUI reps were to be fair non existent  the arrival was a
7880266,Dreadful  wife received food poisoning  in hospital for 3 days.
788027,"This about our 15th holiday using thonson's, never let us down so far, long may that continue!! It seems to be a well organised company that wants you to have good holidays at reasonable prices and big enough to look after you if anything goes wrong."
7880276,There was a delay on flight  called booking agent sed we have to sort compensation our self.so not helpful hotel was a long distance from town no free bus but great food nice hotel

7880286,Everything was great and we really enjoyed the holiday
7880292,Not a lot really. Only 2 points we picked up on during our stay at the sensatori Mexico: the booking into le cheque- no one goes on holiday to spend hours a day queueing to see if they can get a place. Allocate a date and time on arrival to guests. If th
7880293,The choice of food was excellent  but would have felt less like a canteen if they had used table cloths of an evening.
7880298,Food :excellent Cabin: very clean and comfortable   bed good I prefer feather pillows Entertainment: excellent Service: very very good Islands visited : Fervantura not interesting Day at sea not necessary Staff : excellent
7880300,The booking process was very easy and the website and app made it easy to keep track of payments  online check in  documents etc. Tui made getting to and from the airport to our resort very easy and  although we did not take advantage of them  it was goo
7880301,Easy pick up and transfer to hotel and like wise for the return to the airport. The Tui reps were very informative
7880303,Wasn't a tui holiday but the flight was  really pleasant staff  probably the best I have came across  would highly recommend. I've had a tui holiday in the past and it was great. Amazing for kids and families.
7880319,The recommendation of hotel  the booking of holiday   the transfer to hotel  pre booking of excursion in the uk. We were given two different welcome pack therefore a bit confusing as they had different meeting times. So arrived at meeting halfway through
7880328,Needed assistance at airports leaving newcastle was fine leaving allicante was horrendous and very stressful.
7880338,flights were on time outward and return the hotel was everything and more than we were told to expect The area and all facilities in the hotel were perfect
7880340,Rooms were lovely  but cleaning could have been better. Food was plentiful but not always warm. By the end of the week i struggled to have something different. Drinks were plentiful and the entertainment team were excellent providing entertainment for bo
7880348,Checking in at tenerife airport takes for to long. Made to feel like you are being herded. Solution open more desks!
7880354,keep doing what you do best  cannot think of anything that could be improved.
7880356,Overall I did not use the service except to fly and hotel. I felt that the que at Tenerife airport was a bit to much with some old folk and young struggling.
7880360,The organisation of the whole holiday package was very good. When we arrived  we were accommodated to our room immediately. The room was spacious  the balcony view wasn’t it’s biggest advantage though. Great location of the hotel  right by the sandy beac
7880368,The whole holiday was excellent  the flight  the hotel accommodation  the food was probably the best yet. The only things that caused a bit of concern was the confusing lift system. Many people were rambling around trying to get to their rooms but it too

7880427,Ease of booking online. Much cheaper onlone than in store which where you may be missing out. I'd hate for my local TUI branch to close as they can't match the online price! I do prefer to speak to someone face to face rather than call a call centre.
7880431,Didn’t see the Tui rep at all or get contacted by them at our hotel as requested. Didn’t feel any amazing benefit booking they tour operator over making separate bookings myself.
7880442,Flight and transfers to and from the hotel went very well. We had a lovely holiday. The booking process on line was an absolute nightmare. I will not be booking on line again. It took nearly 3 weeks to resolve and several phone calls around the g confirm
7880449,Booking holiday went well with follow up call from shop before departure date. Flight was great  kept the kids entertained and reps were great organising everything  really helpful  always around for questions and keeping the kids entertained.
7880471,The hotel was exactly as described. Check in was quick and straightforward and our cases were taken to our room while we had a drink and sandwich - appreciated at such a late hour and after a long journey.
7880487,Had a fab time couldn’t fault the hotel  food service and staff were brilliant. Very helpful.
7880491,From booking on line to the shop  holiday reps  airport staff & cabin crew professional yet friendly & approachable
7880492,I was helped in getting my tickets for a break to Cyprus  with my friend who has an apartment there. the purpose of the trip was a rest bite  the crew were great very polite and accommodating  and my journey went very nicely.
7880510,Went to Niriides apartments in Psalidi Kos. Lovely 2 bedroomed apartment. Spotlessly clean. One downside  very noisy from building site outside our apartment. Luckily  we didn't spend anytime at apartment during the day.
7880512,well after an 8hr  plus^ flight delay  gathered with fatigue and sickness did not make for a good holiday . It was not your crews faultthough  your staff were loverly and the stand in crew were no less than brilliant. Given this dreadful experience we ha

7880557,Holiday whit Tui are always the best????
7880560,Shame it cost me £30 to speak and book with someone on the phone. Internet is ok  but human interaction can not be ignored. Also the site did not inform us that the spa was out of order.
7880569,everything was explained fully during the booking of our holiday and was kept up to date by e-mail
7880581,It was  without a doubt  the most wonderful holiday. You could not have done any more  than what you had so highly achieved already. From the lovely staff  to the food  to the airline crew  nothing was too much trouble for them. The Family life Nevis is

7880602,We had no problems with any part of the holiday  check in was good  transfer was good and the holiday rep was very nice.
7880604,Hi  the holiday in Gran Canaria was brilliant. This was our third visit to the Baobab resort  and it was very relaxing. The weather was great. The food at the hotel was superb  I think it was actually better than last year  and some of the chefs were rea
7880621,Good Morning   My partner ( Mrs Melledew ) and I were flight only to Gran Canaria so we can only comment on that part of this survey . However we particularly want to commend one of the flight attendants ... Laura on our return flight ( TOM 2405 ) on Thu
7880625,Booking - staff member was helpful although failed to tell us everything about a property and I felt a little pushed into booking something I perhaps shouldn’t have. Flights- generally good Holiday- hotel was nice but not to our taste in some respects. L
7880631,Value for money  flights on time  staff available at airport.
7880638,very little could be improved on hence my score of 9
7880642,I was a flight only booking in this instance and was very happy with the pleasant and helpful cabin crew. Well done.
7880651,The only suggestions for improvement are there could have been an extra mirror in the apartment so you could dry your hair and to get safer transfer drivers  as the one on the way back to Bourgas airport nearly ran me over (as he didn't check his mirror 
7880662,Have already booked to go back next year to cortijo blanco really enjoyed again a lovely hotel to relax
7880674,flight and transfer was good
7880682,After my husband & i having the most horrible honeymoon & me also having my 40th while away (living in a filthy apartment & getting nothing for our special occasions) in the guacimetalanzarote ?? Tui was amazing & put us in premium seats on our way home 
7880685,Majorca was beautiful lovely beach nice bars and restaurants and a really chilled out place to visit but our balcony was on the main strip so did not get much sleep as really noisy with traffic and no air com and tho we had to get a fan from reception it
7880687,Enjoyed a week in Salou  Costa Dorada in September. The whole trip was well organised from start to finish  and our TUI rep was always around or contactable. Food in the hotel was decent although there was not much selection for me (as a vegetarian). We 
7880710,Hotel was very clean  food albeing buffet style was excellent chefs always checking & replenishing when just half empty also good variety. Staff in dining areas friendly & helpful. Would go again to the Tababie Princess
7880720,yes
7880729,We usually always book with Tui  as you are guaranteed good service and an honest feedback from previous customers who have holidayed there. The flight staff on this holiday were superb. I was really ill on the day we came home and they came to chat with
7880731,Most things went well  shame about the 2.5 hr delay on the outbound flight  but I guess that's not too bad when compared to some of the horror stories one reads about.
7880744,The hotel was cleanless. And nobody was cleaning the room. There was a lot of dirt of somebody who was leaving before. Flight was awful  because plane seats was to small. But holidays was good
7880757,Complex is fantastic would recommend to anyone with families. I made the mistake of flying from Manchester T2 which was a disaster. Rude ignorant unprofessuo al and untrained people who couldn't give a dank about customer service. Horrible experience.
7880759,Minor issues - no access to the aeroplane seating plan until after you have paid for select your seats / extra space etc. Even budget airlines provide this seating plan during the booking process in order that an informed choice can be made. We chose ext
7880763,All members of staff working for TUI were friendly and approachable and always happy to help. However  we were disappointed with one of our excursions (the Reykjavík city tour) whilst in Iceland as we were given an inadequate amount of time at several st

7880790,Absolutly nothing loved every minute
7880791,The holiday was well organised. Checking in at the airport went smoothly.
7880805,The planes were comfortable and the staff friendly and attentive. However on the flight out and back we were delayed by approximately 2 hours each Way. On the way back from Alicante there was a lot of confusion and lack of information. When on the plane 
7880816,Holiday fine just a few clinches with booking seats together on the online app. We managed to get seats going together but not back. But we had good seats with lots of leg room
7880824,Good flights and hotel The flight on the way back was delayed and the transport put back 2 hours. We were not informed and left waiting outside the hotel until someone fr9m the hotel rang the transport . A text or email would have been appreciated.
7880826,I took a flight home from Ibiza  all staff were fab but felt there could have been better organisation from the TUI staff at the check in desk. I called TUI during my holiday as was having trouble checking in online as it was very unclear in the ONE emai
7880831,Standard of hotel was good and staff helpful..Food was very plentiful with wide  buffet starts and deserts made for a wide choice. the hotel would not server tap water so we had to buy bottled water (glass ) which has a carbon footprint and is expensive 
7880835,Customer service let’s Tui down. Completely abandoned  no Rep seen at hotel and not even any information at the hotel. Very poor  can learn a lot from Jet3

7880858,lousy flight times
7880866,Poor food in the restaurant
7880875,Everything was perfect on board incl staff  food and entertainment but our flight transfers were not. Our flight from Cork was nearly 2 hours late leaving and ended up holding the boat late  we had to queue for an hour to check in for our return flight a
7880877,Hotel was good  but there were a few niggles  such as not providing any water to guests. I appreciate they were trying to be as ^green^ as possible  but surely one bottle per guest with the message please reuse would be acceptable - after all  the bottle
7880886,On arrival  we were asked to pay a tourist tax before we could register for our room. The website does not mention this. We were extremely disappointed that the complex catered for the overwhelming number of Italian guests. Nowhere on the website does it
7880894,Flight was late and the plane was filthy on the way home
7880898,Excellent reps. Help and information.
7880914,Outgoing flight  transfer  accommodation were all great  thanks. The return flight was great until we got off the plane at Newcastle. For some reason there was only one set of steps for us to get off the plane. When we got off the plane and onto the bus 
7880916,we enjoyed the cruise but the food could be better
7880920,We didn't get much sleep because the walls were too thin and TVs too loud. The hotel food entertainment staff excellent. The only problem was next doors television on till 2.00am. People should keep volume low after 12.00. This problem was because no sou
7880921,No holiday Rep in resort so was not able to book any excursions. Only phone number provided by Rep at airport was one for a UK based center. Pretty useless. Transfer back to airport never arrived. 8 elderly people were left stranded  luckily  we managed 
7880922,The only complaint that I have is the length of time that is spend sitting on the coach at the airport waiting to leave for the hottel. I cant understand why when we arrived at the resort and only had to go around the corner to the hottel the driver turn
7880932,Hotel was exactly as advertised  could have been the room in the photo. Standard of buffet food was not great but that is to be expected. TUI entertainment staff were excellent  loads to do for kids  always something going on  kept the adults amused too.

7881009,All good
7881012,It's nice to have everything done for you
7881031,The flights were on time more or less. Seating room was ample for the legs and the arms despite being large sized. The in-flight experience was secure and comfortable. The price was very low because most of the airplane was booked by travel packages The 
7881044,The hotel room were put in was so small it was definitely meant for a single person and it took 3 days for them to find us another room for us.The pillows were far to long for the bed they were hanging over the side of the bed on both sides .
7881045,Would like to see more sociable time slots for flights. The out going flight was great  but  home bound flight a bad time and very little leg room - making it a very uncomfortable night flight.
7881059,The care taken at both airports was great as we had assisted for one of are party in Tenerife they were absolutely brilliant letting us book in early and depositing the luggage the hotel was clean only had one problem internet very poor the staff very he

7881128,Good holiday at the hotel Angela in Fuengirola food good could do with more choice of gluten free desserts also a bit more variety in entertainment.
7881136,Holiday was amazing. The entertainment was 100% every night.
7881153,Price was low was able to get extra luggage without great cost. Possible cause was that we booked our tickets independently while most of the other passengers were travelling in packaged deals (tickets + accomodation). Excess seats left over from package
7881160,The hotel was clean and staff friendly. What spoilt the holiday was the food was always cold. The water in the urn for making tea never hot enough. At the welcome meeting we told the rep Anika  but nothing changed all week. One morning there wasn’t any c

7881184,Can't think of anything
7881200,All
7881201,I think the 'all inclusive' drinks package is a con as water and other drinks are not included and incur a 'supplement' - for example bottled water is charged for as is cranberry juice bizarrely  as are other 'branded' soft drinks. Also  there was a supp
7881204,Visited shop to book but know one got back to me so I ended up searching and booking online Other than that happy

7881270,Holiday very good only to be spoilt at airport on way home very unorganised and a lot of queuing
7881279,I have been to cape verde many times and stayed the Melia Dumas which had in my opinion gone downhill last year so thought I would try the Riu. What a huge disappointment. The rooms are in desperate need of an upgrade  the sunloungers are that close toge
7881280,Club Aida is amazing  great staff and location. The entertainment team make this hotel and are the reason why lots of guest return year after year. We always book with TUI as we know we will get looked after from booking the holiday until the holiday is

7881291,The hotel was great  free air conditioning and safe in room. The food was fabulous  lots of choice. My only negative is that diet drinks weren’t served in the main restaurants although they were available at the beach and by the pool. As I am a diabetic

7881325,Holiday overall was good. Could not fault the hotel Only negative was flying with easyJet. Both flights were delayed by an hour which when flying with an 8 month old became frustrating as arrived late to the hotel. The food was limited and low stocked.
7881337,Everything was good no negatives.
7881342,We had booked two adjoining rooms for a family of four adults but when we checked in at the hotel we were offered a villa! Excellent accommodation  shared pool and a lovely restaurant by the sea for breakfast. The only improvements would be for the fligh
7881344,Everything was excellent from booking to arriving and back home again.
7881351,Having previously holidayed with jet2 the service they provide of collecting your luggage at the hotel For departure flight is wonderful and think this should be considered by First choice
7881373,From going to your shop in Spalding very good and helpful friendly staff to easy booking in at the airport to resort. The staff at the resort were very helpful with any questions we had. Only one small issue having spoken to other holiday makers who were

7881385,Not a lot
7881386,Good value for money. I could have done without the email informing me that check-in was open - when it wasn't!
7881395,The travel advisor was very knowledgable and helpful  she found us a deal on attraction tickets for while we were on holiday. The experience would have been better if the price on the in store system matched the online price as this would have saved us t

7881425,Room food and service were excellent. Timing of flights could have been improved.Staff were very friendly and service was always prompt
7881443,Good holiday - the app is a great idea! I think the excursions could be improved - more choice and also not such a hefty price. You can go down the road and book the excursions for around 20% cheaper then if you buy through TUI. An option to purchase in 
7881450,Nice Hotel but the info regarding the beach is misleading. There is no beach to talk about  just rock. For the benefit of others  the extra cost for the premium side of the hotel does not appear to be worth it. It’s a lot more money for a little extra. T

7881514,I did not get assistance with mobility at the airport. I had booked it 4 days before. I did not like the beach party at the resort as it was a con. £10 and they said there would be fireworks and foam and there wasn't. Also a tombola  yet the prizes were

7881632,Everything was fab
7881633,All the holiday went well  the only improvement needed is the wasp situation. Steps were being taken but it was very unnerving trying to get drinks from the outside bars and drinking/eating at sun beds. Especially when you have small children. Everything

7881654,Destination good  hotel average  Rhodes airport dreadful
7881659,The hotel was over rated. The food was not 5 star. The staff were mostly pleasant but the restaurant booking experience was not acceptable. We decided to eat out because of this which meant our all inclusive experience wasn't 100 percent. Regarding our r

7881927,We travelled on the day of the hurricane in Portugal so had to divert around the storm to get to Faro. We left a few minutes late and arrived in Faro only half an hour late. Was very impressed by the airline and its staff.
7881940,Our hotel room was very noisy we had a generator underneath that ran continually day and night . The rubbishbins were also located under us which were emptied every morning at 3.30am. Also because of the rubbishbins we could not have our patio doors open
7881949,We had a great holiday and would recommend the Kalliston hotel. We would also love to return. A couple of points  the decor in our room was startinf to look tired. The seal on the shower door needed replacing as there water leaked through each time. We w
7881950,The hotel was more like a ^3^ star hotel and not a 4 star hotel  the food was quiet basic  I asked for a double and got a twin room  there was hardly any provision made for adult entertainment  the adult part being BINGO. All in al a disappointing holida
7881952,Forgot to mention  the bed in the master bedroom requires attention. Extremely noisy when any sort of movement was made.
7881954,The flight and hotel were great. the hotel small and friendly. We will use you again as there were no problems. As we didn't have any problems we had little contact with your rep.
7881955,The food was wonderful and so was the room. Staff were great too. Always kind and helpful. Everything looked clean and well presented in the hotel  so it was a great holiday. The delays on flight going out to Cyprus were the only disappointment.
7881958,Our holiday was great the food was lovely the hotel was clean and tidy and very nice and the hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. I would definitely go back to the hotel. The flights were great and again the staff were friendly and nice. Overall
7881959,I only had my return flight with you and I felt the plane was very cold even though I had a light jacket on and most air con around me was off
7881970,The booking process  online checking in a provision of API was simple. The cost of the flights were reasonable. At the airport there was absolutely no hassle and staff were very helpful  it made traveling with an infant so easy. On board the crew were ve
7881981,In general everything went well  apart from the departure experience.
7881983,Really impressed with the hotel & all of the TUI staff. Food was very good with a good variation  however breakfast could do with a little more variation. Entertainment staff were great and and kept kids & adults entertained in all weathers

7882051,Very friendly and knowledgeable towards customers by keeping us informed; for example arrival times  departure times etc
7882052,Excellent holiday.tui staff went the extra mile to make our holiday special. I am not in good health but that tui staff made sure i was well accomodated. Thank you do much. Only let down was the special assistance which was non existent but nothing to do
7882056,the staff on the flight back from Tenerife south on 1st october to doncaster were very friendly and helpful . yes i know they had more free time due to flight only half full but it was honestly one of the best flights ive had .
7882058,Easy to book online  obvious staff at the airport especially when arriving in Bulgaria. Hotel rep not very useful for a few practical things like a local map or local bus times. She only wanted to give her phone number for contact and may have been best 
7882059,Nice holiday break . The Dublin airport check In could have been better organised but would not put me off booking again
7882062,Excellent flight...transfer...hotel Would strongly recommend . And the resort is top class.. Never been to Portugal before but Tui made my first trip memorable

7882067,More assistance on the flight
7882076,The shop staff were friendly and helpful by taking time to find a holiday for us  the airline staff were ok going but coming back there were very good and chatty and helpful  the resort staff were also helpful.
7882086,Flight only  great crew and flight
788209,Friendly staff always willing to help. The staff go beyond what is expected of them. Excellent organisations skills.
7882094,Crew on the flight was really nice  comfortable seats  land in time  the fact that they call us to embark by rows make it easier and faster other aerlines should use the same system
7882106,Organised very well. We had 2 disabled people in wheelchairs and everything ran smoothly
7882116,Flights on time. Well priced. Convenient time of day and great staff both in the airport and on the plane. Well organised boarding at Manchester. Lots of turbulence on return journey but staff confident and reassuring. All in all a good experience at bot
7882125,This is the second time that we have holidayed with Tui. On both occasions we have been impressed with the organisation  the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the accommodation. I would holiday with Tui again.
7882129,The hotel rooms and staff were good  but we felt the hotel let it's clients down with the quality of the food and that the hot dishes were nearly always Luke warm at best and cold at worst. The range of drinks on the all inclusive was very small  no mart
7882134,Booking of initial flight went well  straight forward and responsive. Flight outbound no issues  professional and polite Return Flight  information incorrect with view to terminal  and check in closed early. Member of staff  not sure if TUI but on check 
7882138,Very pleased with hotel  felt food could have been kept hotter  one microwave was there but was not always easy to get to because of placement; staff friendly  lovely holiday
7882143,Location and hotel were really good  the hotel food was good although the buffet format felt a bit repetitive towards the end of the week (more individual restaurant options would be good) and we didn’t find the entertainment particularly enjoyable and t
7882145,Would have scored higher but outbound and inbound flights were both delayed by an hour.
7882148,Holiday went very smoothly  on-line booking has become a bit of a farce. Had to wait up until 0100 hrs for it to open.
7882169,Fantastic service
7882174,Staff were wonderful  helpful answering all enquires with a smile Atmosphere amazing relaxed and easy going Tours certainly captured the feel of the island

7882208,Very enjoyable holiday  All very smoothly  until the last day  the pick up time was scheduled for 10am  our flight was at 12.10pm. The travel time from the hotel to the airport is usually half hour. I felt this was cutting it fine. On the day  the bus tu

7882214,Very enjoyable. Plenty of food choice at breakfast. We ate out in evenings  trying local food. Staff excellent and very helpful. Management/ Staff relationship seemed strained. Seemed more 3 star plus rather than 4 !
7882216,My tui flight was very comfortable. On time  i was very very happy with the full experience and I look forward traveling with tui again
7882219,Resort experience fantastic Flight terrible cramped and to hot
7882227,Hotel was lovely only thing which would of made it better was fruit for breakfast other than that nothing  staff in the hotel couldn’t be more helpful if they tried they called you by your name everyday they saw you and asked if they could get you someth
7882228,Hotel meticulously clean. The dining room well laid out and the assortment of food hot/cold was very good  something to suit everyone. Bedrooms were spacious @ well maintained. My only gripe would be the fridge  more like a cool box. Apart from that this

7882265,Our initial experience - attempting to book a holiday in the Kingswood store  Hull - was poor. The two girls who helped us lacked knowledge and kept skipping past holidays  talking us out of them. When I got home I looked at one of these in detail and it
7882271,From the moment my Wife and I visited the TUI Travel agent in Carlisle to returning home after the holiday we were absolutely delighted with the staff in TUI and the Hotel staff. They were so professional. The advice they gave us was detailed  very helpf
7882279,Great holiday from start to finish. Website great and so easy to book. Will definitely book with you again and have recommended your site to everyone. Thanks again
7882280,We stayed at the Levante Park Hotel. We were disturbed the next morning at around 6 am (and the next 3 mornings at around 6 am) by furniture being scraped around  doors slamming and people talking. We asked to change rooms on the first and on the 3rd day
7882289,There was little wrong with our holiday  in fact I can.t think of anything to moan about. The walk to and from the aircraft I found difficult and now realise I should have organised a buggy. Jet 2 customers were also in our hotel and we were envious of h
788229,Flight a little late
7882291,Was all brilliant hotel was amazing
7882294,The flight out didnt have any blankets after requesting. The quality of the hotel/resort we stayed in didn't match the quality of the star rating. The food was cold  limited and the restraunts wernt open in the all inclusive. We were limited to where we 
7882296,The friendliness and culture of the smaller type ship is disappearing from the fleet and it is obvious that Marella is trying to change its customer base to the younger generation even though the older generation have a larger disposable income and time 
7882310,Hotel was brilliant. Very clean and very good food. Made lots of new friends. Weather was excellent all week. Wish we had booked for a longer stay
7882316,15kg luggage allowance could be improved  without having to pay extra.
7882322,Hotel good  clean with friendly staff. Very good location. Game of Thrones tour was good but felt it was overpriced for the content. Montenegro Kotor Cruise was disappointing  long ferry ride to the main boat  lunch food poor and the Lady of the Rocks is
7882330,The ship was kept very clean. the food was great and service by the staff was excellent. The destinations were great however the taste of santa marta excursion was poor with little to see and what made it worse was being in a vehicle with limited visibil
7882342,TUI as a company I believe does not value customers. I usually book in store who match prices this year they would only do for an admin fee. I therefore booked on line which was simple  but I prefer to book in person. For that alone I might as well go to
7882353,Very easy to book on line. No problems with flights  transfers or accommodation.
7882354,The Dream is a mid sized ship which my wife and I much prefer and  although it is slightly dated  it is well appointed  very clean and the crew are friendly and courteous. The food and entertainment were very good and we thoroughly enjoyed our short but

7882357,The hotel was excellent.  the food   the room and the staff. Our problem was with the evening entertainment. We found it so difficult to find out what was on offer that after the third evening we gave up and went to another bar. What we did encounter was
788237,It is in a very good spot for a lot of things bars shops
7882377,T.he Flight and transfer went well. The Hotel was a very good standard and service of the staff. The location of the Hotel was perfect for the beach and shops. The Room was very good. The Breakfast was excellent with a good choice. The only let down was 
7882383,The cabin crew both ways were nice. Not too much interaction with the passengers but professional enough. The rep was informative by explaining our check out options and available at the resort and was a local so knew the island very well. The flight tim
